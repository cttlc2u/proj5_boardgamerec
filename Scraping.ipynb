Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn\\'t be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother\\'s side, would be delighted.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&amp;mdash;leading to immense variety.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Dominion series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<yearpublished value=\"2008\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<minplayers

Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn\\'t be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother\\'s side, would be delighted.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck.

You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&amp;mdash;leading to immense variety.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Dominion series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases\\' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists\\' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t

However, this was the game that taught me how to NOT be the &quot;alpha gamer&quot;, and let the game play out as it would in real life.

The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I&apos;d prefer. That said, I&apos;ll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don&apos;t see the entire problem space each game.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"16note\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Rachel&apos;s half\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"1974vertigo2009\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"NORMAL + SOLITARIO\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"1awesomeguy\" rating=\"9\" value=\"My favourite co-op game.

       "<description>In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

I'm in the middle of playing Legacy, however, and I'm afraid that I won't want to play &quot;vanilla&quot; Pandemic after that. We shall see.   As far as Co-Ops go, the only real problem with base Pandemic is the tendency to have &quot;optimal plays&quot;, which almost negates any player feeling like they are truly in control of their turns. However, this was the game that taught me how to NOT be the &quot;alpha gamer&quot;, and let the game play out as it would in real life.

The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.\"/>\n",

The processes of an \"outbreak\" feels as it should: stressful and in need of co-op strategy all the while keeping the fun in it.  Solid with 4 players.  Played a few sessions in solo mode and it seems to work as well.  Co-Op is heavy leaning.  In my sessions, I found that it typically comes to a point where a \"leader\" is set and it can sway to some players just moving through the motions to accomplish the overall goal.

I won't play 2-player with her, though.   I am finding Pandemic Legacy to be a whole lot more interesting, because your decisions carry over from game to game, and it communicates the tension of the theme more effectively. Base Pandemic is just absolutely boring. I think that the base game needs a random deck of 'objective' cards (similar to how you face different objectives in Pandemic Legacy) to spruce it up and keep it fresh.   Beyond that, something that I dislike in all of Matt Leacock's games is the alpha player tendency. I know I can be this kind of player myself, and I hate that the game doesn't do anything to smack me down and keep the collaboration even among players. While it is intensely satisfying to dream up a last-ditch effort to save the world and win the game, it's frustrating that the game doesn't force you to come up with that plan together.   It's Pandemic. I have problems with the alpha-player tendency (which the game does nothing to curb) and the repetitiveness, but it's everyone's favorite co-op for a reason.\"/>\n",

The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.\"/>,\n",

I won't play 2-player with her, though.   I am finding Pandemic Legacy to be a whole lot more interesting, because your decisions carry over from game to game, and it communicates the tension of the theme more effectively. Base Pandemic is just absolutely boring. I think that the base game needs a random deck of 'objective' cards (similar to how you face different objectives in Pandemic Legacy) to spruce it up and keep it fresh.   Beyond that, something that I dislike in all of Matt Leacock's games is the alpha player tendency. I know I can be this kind of player myself, and I hate that the game doesn't do anything to smack me down and keep the collaboration even among players. While it is intensely satisfying to dream up a last-ditch effort to save the world and win the game, it's frustrating that the game doesn't force you to come up with that plan together.   It's Pandemic. I have problems with the alpha-player tendency (which the game does nothing to curb) and the repetitiveness, but it's everyone's favorite co-op for a reason.\"/>,\n",

       "<description>In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.\"/>\n",

In my sessions, I found that it typically comes to a point where a \"leader\" is set and it can sway to some players just moving through the motions to accomplish the overall goal.

I won't play 2-player with her, though.   I am finding Pandemic Legacy to be a whole lot more interesting, because your decisions carry over from game to game, and it communicates the tension of the theme more effectively. Base Pandemic is just absolutely boring. I think that the base game needs a random deck of 'objective' cards (similar to how you face different objectives in Pandemic Legacy) to spruce it up and keep it fresh.   Beyond that, something that I dislike in all of Matt Leacock's games is the alpha player tendency. I know I can be this kind of player myself, and I hate that the game doesn't do anything to smack me down and keep the collaboration even among players. While it is intensely satisfying to dream up a last-ditch effort to save the world and win the game, it's frustrating that the game doesn't force you to come up with that plan together.   It's Pandemic. I have problems with the alpha-player tendency (which the game does nothing to curb) and the repetitiveness, but it's everyone's favorite co-op for a reason.\"/>\n",

       "<description>In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases\\' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists\\' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t

The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I&apos;d prefer. That said, I&apos;ll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don&apos;t see the entire problem space each game.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"16note\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Rachel&apos;s half\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"1974vertigo2009\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"NORMAL + SOLITARIO\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"1awesomeguy\" rating=\"9\" value=\"My favourite co-op game.

What do you want me to say about it, it&apos;s Pandemic?

Base Pandemic is just absolutely boring. I think that the base game needs a random deck of &apos;objective&apos; cards (similar to how you face different objectives in Pandemic Legacy) to spruce it up and keep it fresh. \\n\\nBeyond that, something that I dislike in all of Matt Leacock&apos;s games is the alpha player tendency. I know I can be this kind of player myself, and I hate that the game doesn&apos;t do anything to smack me down and keep the collaboration even among players. While it is intensely satisfying to dream up a last-ditch effort to save the world and win the game, it&apos;s frustrating that the game doesn&apos;t force you to come up with that plan together. \\n\\nIt&apos;s Pandemic.

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases\\' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists\\' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t

That said, I&apos;ll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason).

Base Pandemic is just absolutely boring. I think that the base game needs a random deck of &apos;objective&apos; cards (similar to how you face different objectives in Pandemic Legacy) to spruce it up and keep it fresh. \\n\\nBeyond that, something that I dislike in all of Matt Leacock&apos;s games is the alpha player tendency. I know I can be this kind of player myself, and I hate that the game doesn&apos;t do anything to smack me down and keep the collaboration even among players. While it is intensely satisfying to dream up a last-ditch effort to save the world and win the game, it&apos;s frustrating that the game doesn&apos;t force you to come up with that plan together. \\n\\nIt&apos;s Pandemic.

There is little strategy, and thus victory or failure is mostly a matter of luck, not tactics or skill.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AbigailEMG\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"MJPR\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abisashi\" rating=\"8\" value=\"Also have a bunch of solo plays on my phone.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abkcppm\" rating=\"8\" value=\"Продавам/заменям за 40 лева.\\n\\nЦена - http://bigbag.bg/pandemia\\n\\nРевю - http://gamebox.bg/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8E-%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%8F/\" />\\n\\t\\t</comments>\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n   \\t\\t<statistics page=\"1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<ratings >\\n\\t\\t\\t<usersrated value=\"102309\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<average value=\"7.60594\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<bayesaverage value=\"7.506\" />\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<ranks>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<rank type=\"subtype\" id=\"1\" name=\"boardgame\" friendlyname=\"Board Game Rank\" value=\"99\" bayesaverage=\"7.506\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<rank type=\"family\" id=\"5497\" name=\"strategygames\" friendlyname=\"Strategy Game Rank\" value=\"110\" bayesaverage=\"7.42278\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<rank type=\"family\" id=\"5499\" name=\"familygames\" friendlyname=\"Family Game Rank\" value=\"13\" bayesaverage=\"7.49053\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</ranks>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<stddev value=\"1.32709\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<median value=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<owned value=\"155501\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<trading value=\"2294\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<wanting value=\"644\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<wishing value=\"8998\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<numcomments value=\"16502\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<numweights value=\"5410\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<averageweight value=\"2.4116\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t</ratings>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</statistics>\\n     \\n\\t\\n          \\n</item>\\n</items>'"

Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<yearpublished value=\"1986\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t

username=\".JcK.\" rating=\"9\" value=\"Die Macher is one of the very few long games that I&apos;d like to play on any given opportunity, and I was hugely impressed by its design since my first play. It&apos;s long, but it&apos;s complex, not complicated: there are different rule systems mixed together to portray different aspects of your political campaign, but each of them is simple to understand and to manipulate during the game. \\nMastering the whole system takes time, of course, but you&apos;ll find yourself grasping its main dynamics much sooner than you&apos;d expect, probably just after you&apos;ve gone through the first round of play. So, don&apos;t let its fame scare you: our first game was with two non-gamers, and they both really enjoyed it. The system is streamlined and functional, the theme is well implemented and you can easily imagine your party going through all the vicissitudes of a political campaign. \\nGive it a try if you can :)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"100pcBlade\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Very good deep strategy game but while I don&apos;t mind games of this length, they need have a little less repetitiveness for them to really shine. And the Valley Games implementation is really poor with their choice of card icons which are far too similar. (I also own the original 4p version)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"143245\" rating=\"5\" value=\"Die Macher as a game that is over 30 years old and still played is an example of another time in gaming. Today, the game lacks a certain pizzazz that newer heavy euros have (not just in theme, but mechanical implementation) and it&apos;s more difficult to hold the attention of players. I can see where those who put in the effort to look past the points where modern gamers would say &quot;this really should be streamlined&quot; and study of the design will be rewarded.\\n\\nIn some ways, it&apos;s a game that falls into the same category as Virgin Queen/HiS and the COIN series; long, hulking, beautiful monstrosities that require a full player count to shine. Bonus points if they are all experienced folks. People have to rearrange their lives and schedules to make these sorts of games happen. Die Macher is a wonderful convention game, provided people have agree on a rule set... Unfortunately, that boat seems to have sailed, and the 4th edition is also unlikely to resolve that. That&apos;s not necessarily bad, just an annoyance.\\n\\nThis is an experience, one of those games that was revolutionary at it&apos;s time, and I encourage people to give it a shot. I&apos;d like to sit and tinker with it, to explore how the interlocking pieces and parts all fit together, but at what cost? Do I need a copy on hand? I doubt it, possibly just nearby. Every now and then I think about it, even if it took years to get it to the table, and I&apos;m unsure when I&apos;ll see it played again...\\n\\nedit: The more I fiddle with and talk about the game with others, the more I find that it&apos;s just undercooked, and you have to cobble together an agreeable ruleset in order to get it to really sing.

But it wasn&apos;t as heavy as I expected (sadly). Some luck factor, not large but still significant (especially when it comes to polls). But more depends on interactions between players.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is somewhat strange as the game is way to long for a light, heavy interaction, party game.

This created some interesting aspects in timing, and when to spend money. The rules for the short game were not too complicated. The theme is unique.\\n\\nDISLIKE: The cards created a very luck-oriented feel to the game. I think not allowing a card flush would help with this. There are also some random take-that cards in the poll deck, which felt out of place. I feel some other mechanism could have been used.\\n\\nOVERALL: Not a bad game, but the random elements made the game results seem lopsided. For that much of a time investment, we might be better playing something else. I saw a variant in the BGG forums for mixing in first edition rules, may be worth a look.\\n\\nSome similarities to El Grande, but El Grande is so much better.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamw\" rating=\"8.5\" value=\"I&apos;ve played it. It took 5 hours for 5 of us to march through the game. I really liked it. It never felt slow or bogged down. There&apos;s not much room for AP ever in the game. But it is the same game played basically 6 times in a row. Each state is resolved as you peer ahead to the next 3 coming up. At times, you start getting plans laid out and other times, you find you made a mistake. The random &apos;poll&apos; cards are harsh and scary and frankly, I love &apos;em. They add spice to an otherwise nearly precise mathematical experience (something I generally do not like in a game). I like the dodge and match game with your platforms vs. opponents vs. the state vs. the national end game. There&apos;s really nothing else like the granddaddy of heavy Euros.

No recomenado para principiantes.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adebisi\" rating=\"6\" value=\"2008-08-17\\nA complex game for true gamers. Very rewarding for those who are willing to invest the time to learn the secrets of Die Macher.\\n\\nThe biggest minus comes from the rather big luck factor for such a long game. Losing a 4 hour game in the last minute just because of bad luck can be quite frustrating.\\n\\n2016-03-08\\nIt is remarkable how well Die Macher has stood the test of time. Considering the fact that the game was designed back in the mid 80&apos;s, it is still very relevant. Of course, you have to admit that the game is not as visually pleasing as you would expect today. It almost looks like a prototype. After a while the table also starts to look very busy.\\n\\nOnce you get past the game&apos;s age and looks, you have a solid but heavy strategy game in your hands. Each turn has many steps and is rather complex. There are a lot of things to keep an eye on. Fortunately, there is a fair amount of fluctuation of luck which helps in maintaining the flow of the game. If the Die Macher was purely deterministic, would it surely suffer from too much analysis. Now, since you cannot calculate everything, you can come up with sensible moves within a reasonable amount of time. Of course, very tight games can be decided by chance but usually it is the best player who wins.\\n\\nDie Macher is definitely not the beast its reputation suggests. There are far heavier and more difficult games out there. Yes, the game is long but you do not need the whole day. A game can be finished in an evening.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adiamant\" rating=\"9\" value=\"Wow, great game.

I am eagerly looking forward to playing this one again and wouldn&apos;t turn down the opportunity!!!\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"anonystu\" rating=\"8\" value=\"The shine has worn off: so much of it works so well together, but the last campaign of the game feels too important for a game of such length.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AnttiT\" rating=\"8\" value=\"A game of heavy series politics.

Lots of cross-cutting, interesting mechanics that seem to be nicely thematic.  The card iconography is terrible, and the game play a little bit clunky and time consuming, but overall, I definitely want to play the game again to better understand its subtleties. 8 of 10. (October 2012)\\n\\nOkay, played Die Macher for a second time, the new edition, in February 2020, and for my tastes in game design, I think there are just too many things about this game that feel randomly decisive.  For example, the polling mechanic, and the platform card array with its &quot;luck of the draw&quot; flips, and the blind bidding for turn order.  In general, I really dislike games where blind bidding plays an overly decisive role in the game, and Die Macher seems to feature this problem.  Bottom line: unfortunately, this game now feels like an &quot;old school&quot; euro design, wherein random events are actually considered a fun feature of the design.  Not a fan.  Dropping it to a 6 of 10.  \" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aratar\" rating=\"9\" value=\"Excellent and deep game.

A fantasy world of swashbuckling, of dire magics and dazzling balls, where the royal court provides as much challenge to a player as the battlefields or the faerie forests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;LACE &amp;amp; STEEL takes role playing games out of their rut of dour violence and aggression to offer a whole universe of other possibilities. Characters establish personalities, friendships and hatreds, fears and loves to make interpersonal relations a vital part of play. Rules for romance, repartee conflict, flirtation and fashion give players the unique opportunity to venture into courtly role play-a playing style where the ladies can truly come into their own. For the military minded, there are rules for massed battles and sea fights, deadly magic and duels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;LACE &amp;amp; STEEL is quite unique - ancient magics mingle wth rapiers and muskets to make life doubly dangerous. It is a world where many races thrive - Humans, Half-Horses (centaurs), Satyrs and Harpies, while at the edges of civilization sinister faeries, trolls and ogres lurk in haunted forests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The games systems are clean and simple - easy to learn but entirely flexible. The games most unique assets are its card based conflict systems. Hand-to-hand combat, sorcery and repartee are all simulated by special card games - games that are quick to learn but that offer players the opportunity to fail or triumph according to their own efforts, rather than on the mere hazard of a dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This box contains three booklets of game rules, an adventure booklet and two decks of special cards.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<yearpublished value=\"1989\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpggenre\" id=\"180\" value=\"Action / Adventure (Swashbuckling / Pirates)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpggenre\" id=\"961\" value=\"Fantasy\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpggenre\" id=\"612\" value=\"Social (Relationships / Romance)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<seriescode value=\"\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgcategory\" id=\"2107\" value=\"Campaign Setting (game world)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgcategory\" id=\"2083\" value=\"Core Rules (min needed to play)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgcategory\" id=\"2084\" value=\"Scenario / Adventure / Module\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgmechanic\" id=\"2114\" value=\"Cards (Standard French-suited deck)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgmechanic\" id=\"2112\" value=\"Dice (Primarily d6)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgmechanic\" id=\"2133\" value=\"Race Based (Player Race/Species affects gameplay)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgpublisher\" id=\"10138\" value=\"The Australian Games Group\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgpublisher\" id=\"35100\" value=\"Kitsune Press\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgpublisher\" id=\"16037\" value=\"Pharos Press\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgdesigner\" id=\"6858\" value=\"Paul Kidd\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgartist\" id=\"12364\" value=\"Donna Barr\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<link type=\"rpgproducer\" id=\"6858\" value=\"Paul Kidd\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t<comments page=\"1\" totalitems=\"6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aia_\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Conditions (Acaeum grading): NM\\nStill in shrink\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"jhkiley\" rating=\"4\" value=\"Have never run or played.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"loiosh13\" rating=\"3\" value=\"Had a bad experience in the past with the publisher/designer, plus the game itself just isn&apos;t that interesting.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Paolo Robino\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"RPG item #50000! ;)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Rindis\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Paul Kidd.

value=\"Die Macher is one of the very few long games that I&apos;d like to play on any given opportunity, and I was hugely impressed by its design since my first play. It&apos;s long, but it&apos;s complex, not complicated: there are different rule systems mixed together to portray different aspects of your political campaign, but each of them is simple to understand and to manipulate during the game. \\nMastering the whole system takes time, of course, but you&apos;ll find yourself grasping its main dynamics much sooner than you&apos;d expect, probably just after you&apos;ve gone through the first round of play. So, don&apos;t let its fame scare you: our first game was with two non-gamers, and they both really enjoyed it. The system is streamlined and functional, the theme is well implemented and you can easily imagine your party going through all the vicissitudes of a political campaign. \\nGive it a try if you can :)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"100pcBlade\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Very good deep strategy game but while I don&apos;t mind games of this length, they need have a little less repetitiveness for them to really shine. And the Valley Games implementation is really poor with their choice of card icons which are far too similar. (I also own the original 4p version)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"143245\" rating=\"5\" value=\"Die Macher as a game that is over 30 years old and still played is an example of another time in gaming. Today, the game lacks a certain pizzazz that newer heavy euros have (not just in theme, but mechanical implementation) and it&apos;s more difficult to hold the attention of players. I can see where those who put in the effort to look past the points where modern gamers would say &quot;this really should be streamlined&quot; and study of the design will be rewarded.\\n\\nIn some ways, it&apos;s a game that falls into the same category as Virgin Queen/HiS and the COIN series; long, hulking, beautiful monstrosities that require a full player count to shine. Bonus points if they are all experienced folks. People have to rearrange their lives and schedules to make these sorts of games happen. Die Macher is a wonderful convention game, provided people have agree on a rule set... Unfortunately, that boat seems to have sailed, and the 4th edition is also unlikely to resolve that. That&apos;s not necessarily bad, just an annoyance.\\n\\nThis is an experience, one of those games that was revolutionary at it&apos;s time, and I encourage people to give it a shot. I&apos;d like to sit and tinker with it, to explore how the interlocking pieces and parts all fit together, but at what cost? Do I need a copy on hand? I doubt it, possibly just nearby. Every now and then I think about it, even if it took years to get it to the table, and I&apos;m unsure when I&apos;ll see it played again...\\n\\nedit: The more I fiddle with and talk about the game with others, the more I find that it&apos;s just undercooked, and you have to cobble together an agreeable ruleset in order to get it to really sing. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s worth my time anymore.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"1Aspielerin\" rating=\"6\" value=\"first edition for 4 players\\r\\n\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"3greyhounds\" rating=\"7.5\" value=\"Awesome game.

Also, although this needs more than 1 play to really appreciate/properly rate this game, how likely is it that you&apos;re going to get at least 3 people to sit down for another 6-8 hour game again (especially if someone got burned by the randomness of the game the first time)?

But it wasn&apos;t as heavy as I expected (sadly). Some luck factor, not large but still significant (especially when it comes to polls). But more depends on interactions between players.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is somewhat strange as the game is way to long for a light, heavy interaction, party game.

This created some interesting aspects in timing, and when to spend money. The rules for the short game were not too complicated. The theme is unique.\\n\\nDISLIKE: The cards created a very luck-oriented feel to the game. I think not allowing a card flush would help with this. There are also some random take-that cards in the poll deck, which felt out of place. I feel some other mechanism could have been used.\\n\\nOVERALL: Not a bad game, but the random elements made the game results seem lopsided. For that much of a time investment, we might be better playing something else. I saw a variant in the BGG forums for mixing in first edition rules, may be worth a look.\\n\\nSome similarities to El Grande, but El Grande is so much better.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamw\" rating=\"8.5\" value=\"I&apos;ve played it. It took 5 hours for 5 of us to march through the game. I really liked it. It never felt slow or bogged down. There&apos;s not much room for AP ever in the game. But it is the same game played basically 6 times in a row. Each state is resolved as you peer ahead to the next 3 coming up. At times, you start getting plans laid out and other times, you find you made a mistake. The random &apos;poll&apos; cards are harsh and scary and frankly, I love &apos;em. They add spice to an otherwise nearly precise mathematical experience (something I generally do not like in a game). I like the dodge and match game with your platforms vs. opponents vs. the state vs. the national end game. There&apos;s really nothing else like the granddaddy of heavy Euros. And there likely never will be. Very fun.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Requiere inmersion en el juego, 4 horitas mínimo. No recomenado para principiantes.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adebisi\" rating=\"6\" value=\"2008-08-17\\nA complex game for true gamers. Very rewarding for those who are willing to invest the time to learn the secrets of Die Macher.\\n\\nThe biggest minus comes from the rather big luck factor for such a long game. Losing a 4 hour game in the last minute just because of bad luck can be quite frustrating.\\n\\n2016-03-08\\nIt is remarkable how well Die Macher has stood the test of time. Considering the fact that the game was designed back in the mid 80&apos;s, it is still very relevant. Of course, you have to admit that the game is not as visually pleasing as you would expect today. It almost looks like a prototype. After a while the table also starts to look very busy.\\n\\nOnce you get past the game&apos;s age and looks, you have a solid but heavy strategy game in your hands. Each turn has many steps and is rather complex. There are a lot of things to keep an eye on. Fortunately, there is a fair amount of fluctuation of luck which helps in maintaining the flow of the game. If the Die Macher was purely deterministic, would it surely suffer from too much analysis. Now, since you cannot calculate everything, you can come up with sensible moves within a reasonable amount of time. Of course, very tight games can be decided by chance but usually it is the best player who wins.\\n\\nDie Macher is definitely not the beast its reputation suggests. There are far heavier and more difficult games out there. Yes, the game is long but you do not need the whole day. A game can be finished in an evening.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adiamant\" rating=\"9\" value=\"Wow, great game.

(October 2012)\\n\\nOkay, played Die Macher for a second time, the new edition, in February 2020, and for my tastes in game design, I think there are just too many things about this game that feel randomly decisive.  For example, the polling mechanic, and the platform card array with its &quot;luck of the draw&quot; flips, and the blind bidding for turn order.  In general, I really dislike games where blind bidding plays an overly decisive role in the game, and Die Macher seems to feature this problem.

There&apos;s nothing special about this game -- nothing more special than, say, Hearts or Spades.  The reason it&apos;s fun is because trick-taking is fun, but if you want to paste a theme on a trick taking game, then [thing=20079][/thing] is a lot more enjoyable.  In Dragonmaster, there are 5 &quot;suits&quot; just to try to prevent you from using a deck of cards, but you could make the same game by using a [thing=760][/thing] or [thing=50][/thing] deck, and have a more enjoyable game with a smaller learning curve.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aldie\" rating=\"7\" value=\"cool art - a classic.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"alfonzos\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Not yet played but I have the read the rules.

Each player gets a turn at being the DragonMaster, which means, after looking at their hand, they get to dictate which cards should be avoided in each hand.  There are 5 hands played per round, which the DragonMaster choosing one of the 5 listed options for each hand, using each one once.  The DragonMaster gets points from a player who takes a trick containing one of the taboo cards.\\n\\nSo, essentially, the DragonMaster tries to maximize the points he receives from other players, while the other players do everything they can to avoid the bad cards for that trick.\\n\\nIn the end, I really enjoyed it, with the caveat of the custom card ranks being hard to remember.  It would be much easier to have 4 suits numbered 1-8, rather than 4 suits, each with King, Queen, Prince, Wizard, and 4 other cards I can&apos;t remember the names of.

This is one of the greatest trick-taking (non-standard card deck) games there are. The mechanism that it uses works perfectly (you generally do NOT want to take a trick) and creates a game that can be tense and nerve-wracking, all at the same time extremely fun and strategic. My only caveat is to recommend NOT playing with the Dragon card, as it seems to be too chaotic and wreaks the balance of the game.\\n\\nA great game for both 3 and 4 players.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Floydski\" rating=\"6\" value=\"A Lovely tarot sized card game.

The power plays, both announced and secret add a wonderful depth to Dragonmaster.  The art work is amazing.  The expert game is the best way to play, but the scalability of difficulty is a nice addition as it allows new players to ease in and learn strategies.  Quick playing, strong decision making, and fun Dragonmaster is a long OOP game that deserves a second look.  \\n\\nUpdate:  After a few plays, and the beauty of the illustrations no longer fresh and blinding as before Dragonmaster is really a tired game that is outdone by many other trick taking games. 7 to 5.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Furunkulus\" rating=\"10\" value=\"My absolute favorite trick taking game.

Do they still make games like this?\\n\\nSome say it&apos;s abstract but to me it looks thematic. Castes, tiles, board and screen all make sense. Abstract is what Ingenious looks like; Samurai is not that abstract. \\n\\nRules are clear and concise. Knizia usually puts me off with intricate end game conditions but here the scoring is pretty logical. It&apos;s simple as that: you aim to either get a majority in two castes, or get a majority in one caste while staying competitive in the other two castes. In other terms: you need two big scores (AB) or one big score and two small ones (Abc).\\n\\nThere is a slight difference between editions: in the original if no player has majority in a caste, everyone loses. In the zman edition the player with most pieces of all castes wins.\\n\\nFirst player advantage is overrated and is of no significance if players draw starting tiles randomly.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"1000rpm\" rating=\"8\" value=\"Its taken me ages to get around to playing this and what a fantastic game it is!\\nLittle randomness, brain-burning strategy, but brilliantly simple to learn.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"1989Game\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Classic Knizia and one of the all time great area control games.

Brilliant abstract? Check. Tense decisions that affect everyone else around the table? Check. A simple ruleset with a lot of depth? Check. Beautiful plasticy/clacky playing pieces? Checkity check check (oh I love to hear them rattle around in my hand).\\n\\nSamurai is a simple game where you are trying to surround three types of figures: high hats (military), rice paddies (farming), and buddhas (priesthood). These three aspects of Japanese society will generally represent your influence/power over Japan, but let&apos;s not kid anyone: this is an abstract. That&apos;s totally fine, though, because this has the well-seasoned draw of a game that&apos;s confident in its own success and knows, just knows, that it will suck you in. \\n\\nSo how do you get these pieces? You get them by surrounding their spots on a hex map of Japan. When a piece is totally surrounded by player hexes, the relative power of those hexes is compared, and whoever has the highest power for that symbol takes the piece. In other words, we all have hexes that range from 2-4 power, for each symbol, and as we gradually fill up the board, we&apos;re gauging one another&apos;s power around the various cities. \\n\\nThe game ends when every piece has been removed from the board. At that point, we lift our player screens and reveal how many pieces of each type we&apos;ve collected. If one player has a majority in two types of pieces, they win the game immediately. Otherwise, the game goes to a tiebreaker. Players remove all pieces from the type they won, and then compare the number of remaining pieces: most pieces wins. This is a brilliant little piece of strategy since your strongest power will be removed in the case of a tiebreaker -- so you need to be sure to be strong in all three areas. \\n\\nSamurai is honestly simpler to play than explain, but it has some deviously difficult strategy. For one thing, we all have a few pieces that bend the rules of the game -- and we all have the same few pieces, but the timing of when we play them is the challenge! Waiting until the other players have used their valuable &apos;swap&apos; hex makes your remaining swap hex the most valuable move left in the game -- but on the other hand, you could really swap those two tiles, and ahhhh, I can&apos;t wait! I&apos;ll swap it now. \\n\\nIn summary, Samurai is a fantastic game that will see you bumping up against your friends on a too-tight map of Japan. It plays in about 30 minutes with 2-3 players, and can also accommodate 4 thanks to some clever modular boards. Highly recommended, you owe it to yourself to check out this classic.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aardvark\" rating=\"7.5\" value=\"Dry, abstract, but worth the effort.

Such a tense and thoughtful game for how few rules there are. Every move you make is such an agonising decision. Do you want to commit your strongest units now, only to never see them again. Do you want to slowly surround a control point and risk your opponents playing down a bunch of fast units and snatching it away. The couple of special power tiles that are in the game prevent the game from becoming too deterministic and keeps it exciting. Scoring is clever, requiring you to get a majority in one of three categories, but also diversify and have a high number of the remaining two to compete in the tiebreaker.

The theme deserves mechanics less abstarct.\\n\\n2016-02-08\\nSamurai is a pure abstract and the theme is there to only give the players some vague connection between numbers and real life. Instead of assigning a &quot;three&quot; you assign three &quot;samurai&quot;. Samurais represent power which is easy to understand, and this is the only thing along with the map of Japan that connect the game with reality. Of course, it is not always fair to criticise a board game for its lack of reality, since you have to bring things to an abstract level to make a board game in the first place. However, for some reason with Samurai I found the game and the theme were disconnected. \\n\\nBut once I was able to get past that, the game showed its true worth. Every turn you are facing tough decisions, which is something I particularly enjoy. There is enough luck in the tile draw to keep things interesting through introducing some fluctuation in the balance of power. Most of the time your decisions are tactical aiming at short to intermediate term goals, but there is a long term strategy element to the game as well. Scoring is such that it makes all fights over territory meaningful.\\n\\nSamurai may not be the most exciting game out there but it works, and most importantly is fun if you like tactical games and do not mind direct competition. \" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aden\" rating=\"9\" value=\"Fast and fun!

And I&apos;m not sure how to &quot;fix&quot; it.  You put out several piles of blocks each turn, and then players bid for them.  The blocks not won go to build a sort of giant &quot;time clock&quot; pyramid - when it&apos;s built, the game ends.  Cool stuff.  But since some piles are &quot;better&quot; than others, they often get multiple bids, meaning a LOT of other piles get passed up, and, before you know it, that giant pyramid is finished.  I&apos;ve tried putting out fewer piles (less variety made it unbalanced) and fewer blocks per pile (removed the tension of restricted building since you weren&apos;t as locked in).  Both were unsatisfying.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"autumnweave\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Love hate relationship with this.

The proper play seemed obvious to us.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"cymric\" rating=\"3\" value=\"This game is not really what I had hoped it would be. It looks absolutely cool with the triangular board and the emerging pyramids, but there are too few movement points to go around meaning that everyone will happily build in their own little corner only to be bothered by theft once every while; and since unbuilt stones end up in the central pyramid there really isn&apos;t that much incentive to grab more than one group: you won&apos;t be able to build more stones than just that one group anyway. \\n\\nThe result is somewhat of a grating experience which never really wants to take off. Bidding is locked down because you cannot bid too much either (and risk the game&apos;s end coming at you all the quicker), and after that it&apos;s a very precarious balance between stealing from miles away and building in patterns you don&apos;t really want to build but must out of fear the game will end that much quicker for it. The variant rule I dug up from some forgotten website—it may have very well been Spielbox&apos;s—which has you spending left-over bidding power as if they were movement points actually makes a lot more sense under these circumstances. \\n\\nMy fellow players weren&apos;t best pleased with this game, and to be honest I was feeling a little ashamed about putting it in front of them. I want to give it another attempt, though, this time with the knowledge that TdK requires a specific approach; and see what happens then. If it remains lackluster, then it&apos;s off to the great marketplace in the sky, I&apos;m afraid.\\n\\n[b]Update[/b] Recycled for spare parts.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"dakarp\" rating=\"7\" value=\"Very nice looking game.

I quite like it.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"MikeBwithoutadot\" rating=\"6.5\" value=\"New in collection jan. 08 Bought from Lajos.\\n\\nInitial rating:\\n\\nGood Eurogame.

You then build up pyramids using the pieces you got from the auction by using/moving workers. I kind of liked the game but there was too much randomness/chaos for as long game as it was. What combinations comes up to auction and then rather chaotic blind bidding out of them was a tad too much.

There is a huge screwage factor here where players can get closed out of building, turns of work can get stolen, pyramids can get eroded, and all in all people can really get hosed out of their turns.  You have to be prepared for this if you are going to play the game. Overall, I think it is a fine game, that sadly suffers from uneven scoring.  The game just doesn&apos;t make it valuable enough to build up perfect pyramids.  The scores need adjustments.  If this could be done then I think that fans of Taj Mahal would really love this system.  A shame about the 80&apos;s neon and the akward box. \" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"skeletodoc\" rating=\"8\" value=\"A pyramidal experience!\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"sodapop1999\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Beautiful components.

There&apos;s no theme to speak of (unless buying and merging hotel chains is your jam), the component quality is shoddy, and the core mechanic of the game (drawing new tiles) is entirely based on luck. So why is it so highly regarded?\\n\\nFor one thing, it&apos;s so much better than its competition. Other games from the 1960s were even worse, so Acquire stands out even today simply because of its company. If this game were launched amidst the Terra Mysticas, Puerto Ricos, and Pandemics of today it might not be noticed. But as it is, it stands out. \\n\\nSecondly, Acquire presents you with meaningful decisions. The hidden money and stocks mean that you have to keep track of other players&apos; positions as you play, and expand and merge the hotel chains accordingly. Though there is luck in drawing each tile, the fact that you have six of them at a time means that you very rarely have nothing useful to play. \\n\\nThe genius of Acquire rests in its bonus system. When a hotel chain is subsumed into another chain, a bonus is awarded for the player who has the most stock in that company. Additionally, bonuses are recorded at the end of the game as well. This makes merging chains a strategic decision that carries a lot of weight for you and every other player. Often, a skilled player can ride a wave of mergers to a dominant position in the largest remaining hotel chain at the end of the game, and cruise to victory on his bonuses. \\n\\nThis is why Acquire is so great: there&apos;s a great deal of tense thought that goes into every tile placed. It&apos;s a harsh and unforgiving game that rewards players with a good memory, and penalizes those who play carelessly. This type of game isn&apos;t for everyone (it definitely isn&apos;t for my wife) but it will always have a place in my collection because there&apos;s not really anything out there that has replaced it yet.\\n\\nYou can fuggedaboutit when it comes to theme, but Acquire still represents one of the best of 3M&apos;s bookshelf series, and it&apos;s rightly considered a classic. This mind game will have you blocking and maneuvering other players to come out the richest.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aangman\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Ntp\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaron444\" rating=\"10\" value=\"Have played this game with my family since I was a kid (20+ years).

Staying liquid is very important, as my girlfriend learned the hard way in this first play.

Sure, you&apos;re getting a huge advantage in being able to gain money early in the game and that first move is giving you a strong momentum that opponents may have difficulties to recover.

However, I sold this because it got very few plays.\\n\\n2016-04-12\\nAcquire is themed as an economy/market speculation game. However, this description does not fit. It is a tile placement game and you speculate which entities stay on the board the longest and grow the most. \\n\\nYou could kind of expect that a game from 60&apos;s would not provide any real decision but this is not the case here. Players are given a number of tiles to form a personal stack and the contents is for their private information only. Thus you can make some educated guesses which &quot;companies&quot; will grow, and critical tiles give you even some control over the game.\\n\\nThis speculation is really the meat of the game. Tactical decisions and correctly timed moves serve as garnish. You cannot really follow any great strategies since the tiles you draw dictate the possibilities you have.

Many decisions depend on dice roll and if you are unlucky, you loose much time. I think the most important point is that you have to be the first in building your residence, or build it in the same round.

It has a feel similar to other Wallace games (particularly Brass and it&apos;s card mechanism) but it&apos;s basically Populous: TBG.  The options are few, but fairly deep - it&apos;s mostly about timing when to convert your tribesmen to &quot;civilized&quot; folk, which effectively puts them at risk and limits what you can do with them.  The game is a little long for what it is (at least for two) but that can be fixed easily enough by simply removing cards across card types.  This is not a spectacular game, but good enough that even non-fans of Mr. Wallace should look into it (in fact, they might like its striped-down nature more).\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Celtic\" rating=\"7\" value=\"A decent early Wallace - shades of &apos;Populous&apos; in board game form - but there are better conquest games out there (including quite a few later Wallaces).\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"claymore_57\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"From the estate of Richard Lipp.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"crackedlcd81\" rating=\"5\" value=\"Missing something...not much more than fighting, really...\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"dacoutts\" rating=\"5\" value=\"I remember playing this quite a bit...but can&apos;t think why.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Dathkadan\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Warfrog, 2nd edition\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Deeevorce\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"This is a Wallace I probably won&apos;t ever play (and don&apos;t regret not playing it)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Denist\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"2-5\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"dierenh\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Nederlandse samenvatting in tekst opmaak\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"dlminsac\" rating=\"5\" value=\"Unique systems and modular board somehow adds up to not much excitement.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"dougadamsau\" rating=\"5\" value=\"Nice Martin Wallace game where players are trying to maximise points by spreading their barbarians across a hex board.

El Caballero takes us to a new world, where the areas we will try to control are gradually discovered through tile placements.  Instead of cubes or meeples, El Caballero has double-sided tiles with a number on each side.  Place one next to a land or sea area and the number shows how many of your guys are there.  Beyond exerting control, these tiles are useful for blocking the further growth of a land or sea area.  However, they are also vulnerable; a second land tile placed next to one and it is removed.\\n\\nImportant things to understand are why you would want to remove a Caballero tile (to allow further growth of a land or sea which your opponents had not bargained for), and the great value of the 9 power cards, which allow two land tile placements in a turn.\\n\\nA bit of a brain burner that usually resolves into a tight, tense contest. There&apos;s certainly potential for analysis paralysis as Kramer and Ulrich offer plenty of possible actions that can be done in any order.  And then, of course, there is what your opponents might do to consider. In view of this and because it is turn-based, it is probably best played with no more than three.\\n\\nProduction and artwork are both decent, though it really did not need the big box that the few pieces would rattle around in, where it not for a giant insert.\\n\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Angurvaki\" rating=\"5\" value=\"3000 kr. \" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"antiussentiment\" rating=\"7\" value=\"After two plays I think this is a really great game..

So much to watch out for. I won my first game, but I don&apos;t feel like I should have. I made some obvious mistakes and definitely missed some stuff. I don&apos;t have a handle on this one yet. I can&apos;t wait to play it again. I expect my rating to go up after more plays.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI&apos;ve definitely gotten the hang of this game, though I still sometimes miss something that someone else sees. I really like the game. It&apos;s different every time: Sometimes there&apos;s a huge water area that everyone&apos;s trying to get a piece of, and sometimes there&apos;s one big huge land area. Always different. There&apos;s a lot to think about, and it&apos;s very intense--especially the last three rounds, leading up to final scoring.\\n\\nHowever, I never want to play this game within a few weeks after having played it--and even that would be a bit too soon. Even with three players who know the game well and are usually very fast in other games, this game takes three hours. There&apos;s just so much to think about and consider--especially in the later rounds--that the turns take a long time. You can think about your turn ahead of time, but chances are that the tile you wanted or the spot in which you were going to place tiles is gone by the time it&apos;s your turn, so you need to reevaluate everything. There&apos;s a lot at stake, and you can have what seems like an unlimited number of choices, so it can take a while to figure out what the best move is.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"boomtron\" rating=\"6\" value=\"A bit fiddly for El Grande: The Tile Game.

With a rules complexity on par with Tigris and Euphrates, it manages even more depth of play.  This is not a newb-friendly game.  Unfortunately, a tendency exists to degrade into analysis paralysis and excessive downtime.  Furthermore, the nature of the game results in more players (with an accompanying 10 more turns) increasing game length tremendously.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdate:  Further playings have not been kind to El Caballero.  What is at first glance a game with a great breadth of options in a turn, is in fact much less.  Don&apos;t believe the hype, this a bone-dry game, with little tension and torpid mechanisms.

Sadly, this was the game that convinced my husband that he didn&apos;t like Wolfgang Kramer as a designer (which has serious ramifications for several other games in our collection). It is basically an abstract tile-laying puzzle, but unlike Carcassonne, it is mean: you can spend several turns building something up only to have it taken away from you right before scoring.\\n\\nThe biggest problem I have with the game is the turn-order mechanic. Whoever goes last in the previous turn gets to choose their card first in the next turn. This has a distinct disadvantage, because when you choose your card, the other players can decide whether to play higher or lower than you, thus basically deciding turn order for themselves. This can set up a cycle: the last player gets stuck being last player again in the next turn. Generally you want to go first to be able to choose tiles, unless it&apos;s a scoring round, in which case you want to go last, so you can oust your opponent from an advantageous spot: this is easy to accomplish for players who have been going first each turn, because they will still have most of their low cards.

The game play is so stoic as everyone spends their turns trying to min/max their positions and compute the permutations of what their opponents could and might do.  It ends up feeling staid and uninteresting.  Games this dry really only work for me if they are two-player games because then they are faster paced and you can take some pride in victory because there&apos;s no 3rd or 4th person involved to throw the game to someone.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ccomeaux\" rating=\"8\" value=\"Carcassonne that makes your head hurt.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"CDRodeffer\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Not yet played.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Celtic\" rating=\"7\" value=\"I find this a real brain buster but enjoyable all the same.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"cfarrell\" rating=\"9\" value=\"On the one hand, I do kinda sympathise with the feeling on this one that it&apos;s just too heavy; but I like it a lot. It manages to be a tough, challenging game, but yet to have just enough trappings of your average &quot;fun&quot; eurogame to make it engaging. You get to watch the continents grow, your choices are just constrained enough that you have lots of options but not so many your head explodes. This is probably one of the few &quot;card-game&quot; style spinoffs of bigger boardgames in which the nominally smaller game is more intense than the big-box game!

The basic game was decently simple but offered a huge variety of choices each turn, often leading to seemingly long turns and lots of downtime, but the game was over in an hour and was very strategically and tactically satisfying.

I like the cut-throat nature of the map-piece positioning. It has that similar blend of obviously tactical play with nonobvious long-term strategy that El Grande has. The supply/court interplay with the same kind of action cards as El Grande is one of my favorite game mechanics. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing keeping this one from rating higher right off the bat for me is the slowly grinding turns. I don&apos;t generally mind games that some people label as &quot;analysis paralytics&quot; and this one is certainly in that group. Also, as the map gets more complex...the turns get slower and slower. \\r\\n\\r\\nI THINK the gameplay would speed up with more familiarity. In the game I played we were 4 new players. If we could trim our play time by 1/3 I think this would be an 8 or so for me. \\r\\n\\r\\nInitially I didn&apos;t think there was much relationship to El Grande besides the art on the box and the graphic design. The action cards are straight from El Grande. But as I played more, I began to realize it IS about area control....married to tile-laying. Its really a beautifully integrated mechanic. I don&apos;t think El Caballero gets as much credit as it ought to....but there is no doubt that its a brain-burner, cut-throat and tricky. \" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"CortexBomb\" rating=\"7\" value=\"Overlooked semi-oldie by Kramer and Ulrich that is the much more gamey precursor to the Carc series. Basically take the El Grande card auction and guy angst, and then team that up with a Carc style tile collection which is, instead of being a blind draw ala Carc, drafted from a pool. Somewhat brain burney because of all the possiblities for each tile, but not as overwhelming as I&apos;d been led to believe. \\n\\nThe thing that makes this game difficult (but also fun for me) is the interesting timing decisions, indeed, I would say learning how to time moves is probably the thing that makes playing this game well so difficult. When you do something can be just as important, if not more imporant than what you do. Removing and placing caballero cards, placing governors, placing ships, using your tile(s), using the grande...all of them offer little decisions which can add up in the long run.\\n\\nI highly recommend playing with the Governors and Grandes though, both add a lot of interesting tactics to the game. Overall a fun design with enough things going on to be interesting...a gamers only title though, and a little on the dry side.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Cortez the Killer\" rating=\"7.5\" value=\"Conquistador from 999 games\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"crackedlcd81\" rating=\"6\" value=\"I absolutely hated this game the first time I played it...recently tried it again and couldn&apos;t believe I didn&apos;t like it.

It is one of the earlier boardgames so it&apos;s mechanics are quite simple. You have to collect as many cubes from the map as possible (each player has one cube/city). In order to do that you have to plant your trip by using different magical transportation methods (dragon, cloud, etc.). The problem is that once someone uses a transportation method for a road, the others are obliged to use the same one, so the game forces you to recalculate the optimum way to get as most cubes as possible. The rules are easy, but as it has no time limit, the planning phase can be long, too long. \" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"alcofa\" rating=\"7\" value=\"Good and old One.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Alea Istropolitana\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Ľubor,\\r\\nHieroným\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AlexFab4\" rating=\"6.5\" value=\"After 1 to 5 plays\\n\\nNice introductory board game, gonna play it again when bigger games have destroyed our brains.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"alexfan\" rating=\"7\" value=\"Race to visit all the places on the map using various methods of transport.

Another is if I have sufficient players as I think this is best around 5 (enough to create an unpleasant situation, but not enough so you get stuck somewhere). If you can get players who are all aggressive in their negotiations or manipulative in terms of markets/incentives, then the game is a big 8. When you have a group who are more about manipulating each other to their benefit and less about just optimizing their own fields, the game *really* shines. The problem is that to make that happen is once in a blue moon or at least erratically infrequent. Some neat calculations in terms of card counting and the three reshuffles in that you&apos;ll see some information, but not all of what&apos;s come up and is being held. The &quot;you can&apos;t rearrange your hand&quot; is both the most infuriating aspect of the game, and the one that drives it (and in particular, the negotiation phase) forward; suddenly giving away cards or doing lopsided trades make sense if it moves cards out of your hand. Combining that with the initial planting allows you to manipulate and incentivize transactions. I rarely turn down a game if it looks like there are a bunch of folks, but I can&apos;t think of a time when I&apos;ve ever suggested it. Under perfect conditions, an 8, more likely to be a strong 6.\\n\\nedit: More and more, I&apos;m getting better conditions to play the game, and after 25+ games of it, I think it&apos;s an 8.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"144creations\" rating=\"7\" value=\"Good family game or entry-level game for when you need a game that supports higher player counts.

Along the way, there are tons of opportunities for trading/negotiation.  Fixed order of cards in hand is what drives alot of the trading, and is something that new players have to be mindful of. \\n\\nThis is a very light, but very good gateway game (filler material) that works very well with 3-5 players.

Works best with more players, but even at 3 players is really fun (massive piles of sold beans make smaller player-count games really rewarding).\\n\\nThe more you play the more complicated the economics and trading get.

On your turn, you draw tiles from the bag one by one, gradually adding to the lot of tiles that are available for auction. Each turn, the player will decide if they want to draw another tile, or bid on the lot and claim it for their tableau. The catch? Each player has only three tokens to bid with -- and they may not be the value he&apos;d like to spend on the lot. \\n\\nAs such, Ra is a game of evaluating the bids everyone else has remaining, deciding when to pick up a lot with a bid, and making sure to avoid the end of the era with the Ra tiles. Ra tiles make the game even harder, forcing an auction on that turn -- when the board fills up with Ra tiles, the first age is over. After two more ages, the game ends. \\n\\nThere are many ways to score points: from civilizations, to monuments, to Nile-side farms, to powerful God tiles. All in all, the meat of this game comes down to evaluating the current lot, deciding when to bid, and deciding when to push your luck.

Closed economy in this case means that the game should balance itself through the bidding action. Of course, this implicitly means that there is a learning curve to the game because you cannot estimate the true value of the tiles offer on your first play. I liked the fact that in addition to bidding for tiles, closed economy means that you also bid for your position on the next round. So your choices have an impact on both short and long term.\\n\\nThe only thing that felt a bit weird and was a kind of anticlimax to the game, was the round ends. If there was only one player left in the game with more than one RA-tile short of triggering the round end, he was almost certain to get a full display of goodies without anyone being able to do anything about it. But I reckon this a thing to keep in mind and it is the other players&apos; own fault if they let one player do whatever he likes.\\n\\nRa is a classic example of a modern game design without anything but the absolute necessary parts. The result is a game that, maybe is not that flashy and exciting at the first glance when compared with newer games, but offers an experience of reasonable length with a lot meaningful and tough decisions. I do admit that Ra might feel a bit dry at first but if you like bidding games, Ra definitely is one of the better ones. It also was a wonder how good the game feels with just 3 players, which is a rare treat in auction games. Thus Ra deserves a rather high rating.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adiamant\" rating=\"9\" value=\"Not much to say. Classic, classic auction game.

Above all, this was fun.  It has a light feel, but underneath that there is a lot going on.  I felt that the mechanics were very clean and cleverly done, and even though the theme was somewhat bolted on, that didn&apos;t stop me enjoying the game.  Just how much of the tactical play proves to be illusory and how much randomness overcomes thinking is something I will be finding out about over the years, but right now, I think this is a very good game...it helps that I won my first (5 player) session - by using a few simple ideas ;)\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdmiralGT\" rating=\"7\" value=\"Good little auction game.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adonismayhem\" rating=\"7\" value=\"Tanga Purchase\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adriang\" rating=\"8\" value=\"Simple, elegant, fun!\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adrianhon\" rating=\"9\" value=\"Got this for Christmas and played it three times immediately.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, I like some luck in my games. But this one requires too much luck in order to win.

She clobbered us, getting 10 points before my son and I got to five points. I bought this game expecting a lot more strategy and was dissapointed.\\n\\nEdit: I have played this a few more times and, while I still don&apos;t see a ton of strategy in this game, I am seeing more possibilities. I think the expansions will probably go a long way toward increasing replayability.

I can&apos;t deny that I&apos;ve loved and played it a lot. But Catan (especially with no expansions) just isn&apos;t interesting anymore. I have played it upwards of thirty times online against AIs, and as such I&apos;m pretty much played out on the game. Diversify your hexes, go for largest army or longest road (whichever has less competition), and trade only as much as necessary. Spread out and diversify your resources early, then bulk up on cities mid-game. I don&apos;t know, strategies vary, but I just feel like I&apos;m always playing Catan on rails. It feels solved. \\n\\nSo yes, Catan is a great gateway game. It&apos;s exciting for new players who&apos;ve never played a German-style game before. But I don&apos;t need to buy the game, or its expansions -- there&apos;s no need to.

To do those mental gymnastics and calculate out your best possible action, and then find that 2 other people chose the same thing, so you get nothing.

Strategy-wise, it certainly helps to keep an eye on how many gems of a particular color you need in order to lock the majority because the gem &quot;pools&quot; do run out.

With that said, only play this game with 3, and you&apos;ll have a good time.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"cberg\" rating=\"8\" value=\"A very clever trading mechanism makes this game stand out.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"cbrua\" rating=\"4\" value=\"I&apos;m not a big fan of blind bidding games (blind guessing game is more accurate for this one).  Basari is somewhat tolerable because the game length is short (30 minutes) and the barter step for ties is fun &amp; interesting, but still, it&apos;s not a game I will suggest.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"cc_TheToph\" rating=\"7\" value=\"Multiple playings, liked it, worked well as a gateway game.

Only real flaw is the fact that it only really plays well with exactly four. Looking forward to the remake, Edel, Stein, und Reich.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"chaddyboy_2000\" rating=\"5\" value=\"A very interesting design in that players are moving around a track, with each space on the track offering a different amount of points or gems.  Players simultaneously decide what sort of action they want to take based on the space they are on, and it&apos;s generally better to select an action that someone else didn&apos;t take.  So, you evaluate what you think everyone else will choose vs. what you would like to choose.\\n\\nDifficult decisions to make all the time and plenty of player interaction.  Has gotten stale after multiple playings, though\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"chaosbreaker\" rating=\"6.5\" value=\"With three players add the 4th dummy player to make the game more fun.

Players must sell shop space, or buy shop space, and try to guide customers into shops so they can make money. In a nice twist, players gain commissions for sales and for guiding customers into opponents&apos; shops; so there are reasons for moving customers into shops even if they&apos;re not your own. This facet of the game, and the fact that there are queues of customers, ensures a nice flow to the game. Beginning players will have a difficult time gauging how much a shop is worth (location matters of course), and so it probably needs multiple plays to really get a good handle on the mechanism.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"blunxy\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Not pLayed yet.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"BonnieD24\" rating=\"7\" value=\"I don&apos;t usually like abstract games (the theme in this game is very thin), but this game is an exception.

If the right people move in front of a shop they like then they go in and stay there, scoring money to the person who owns the shop (and a cut for whomever moves the pawns).

The game begins with each player auctioning a single stall of their choice, and then play begins proceeding around the table. On each turn you can either move a group from a fountain to the next fountain and move another group; move a group and auction a stall; or auction 2 stalls. \\n\\nThe goal of all of this is to make money, as customers are sucked into shops of their color when they walk by. If you own the shop you get 100 for them and 100 for each person that was already in your shop (as customers are never removed once they go in; make of that what you will thematically!) up to a maximum of 500 per entrant. However, the person who moved the group that deposited that person in your shop also gets a cut out of your earnings, and that goes up as the number of people in there goes up. There is a similar payment made to the person who auctions a new shop.\\n\\nBecause the currency you use to bid on the auctions is the same thing that is used to calculate the game winner the proceedings can be a little slow in the auction, but I like a lot of the ideas in this one. The variable queue of customers outside changes things up considerably, and adds a strategic element when paired with the auctions as you can see who is going to come in and that can dramatically impact the value of some stalls.\\n\\nHelping out other players is not only beneficial but necessary, if someone is going to make a big score you can at least take a cut out of it and further your own gains in the process. The game might have some kingmaker issues, but I think with closed currency holdings that kind of thing (as in the deliberate choice between two players) should be at a minimum as it&apos;s very hard to keep track where all the money is between the auctions, the cuts from that, the customers, and the cuts from that. Because of the length I would classify this as filler, and for that game length this is an amazing title. Fun, would be glad to play any time. \\n\\nPlayers do need to be aware that this is a big-time left/right game though; ideally players are always presenting &quot;gifts&quot; to their left hand neighbor that score both of them points in the process. This can make the auction a bit weird (as stalls can easily be value-added if the auctioneer sets the shopper pieces up correctly prior to conducting an auction) as they generally have much higher value to the next player to take a turn, but this is really at the meat of the game. It can be susceptible to new player issues as a result though. Great regardless, so much going on for such a stripped-back game.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Craig Viau\" rating=\"8\" value=\"This is a very good game.

Until you know how to drive your robot it&apos;s best if you stick to simple one board tracks.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abeille_joyeuse\" rating=\"8\" value=\"I am thinking of using this game in a robotics workshop I run for high schoolers, to introduce programming in an informal way.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abgg\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"brendanm, ndru\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abodi\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Used to rate this an 8, fast fast forward about 6 years and I&apos;d rate this a 6.\\n\\nSuffers from runaway leader issues.

Several programmer friends of mine love the game, and so a friend of a friend brought it out and we finally got to play it.  They said that all programmers love it... but my husband wasn&apos;t too thrilled by it.  Sure, you &quot;program&quot; your robot, but the entire game is about spacial awareness.  I&apos;m great at that... my husband, not so much.  \\n\\nThe game would have gone better if all of us had been allowed to read the rules.  Two of the people playing had played it many times before, and three of us (me included) had never played it before.  We would have benefited from having more things explained.  But that is not a failing of the game, so much as a failing of the people we were playing with...\\n\\nThat said, my husband and I didn&apos;t do too poorly.  We were playing the &quot;tag the flag&quot; gametype where we had to go from one flag to another, in order from one to three, and the first bot to reach three would win.  Everyone in the game at least made it to the second flag.  Some of us got almost to three.  And again, would have been better if we had known more of the rules.\\n\\nHopefully next time (if there is a next time) will be better.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Advocator\" rating=\"7\" value=\"I&apos;ve yet to play this game sober.

It was the game Richard Garfield was pitching without success when he ended up having to fall back on his backup prototype a little game known as mtg. Robo Rally is about a crazy robot race through a series of modular boards with different kinds of obstacles and environmental conditions in order to be the first bot to take flags in each board in sequential order. The catch is you have to program your bots and then execute the actions in order so this leads to all kinds of crazy shenanigans. Especially when you damage other robots and start locking certain commands into their tableu. Robo rally is a good racing game.

But, in general, SdJ winners have gone over very well with my family, so I knew it needed to be added to my collection ASAP.  When I read the rules I had really high hopes for the game too, because of the wacky theme and one of my favorite mechanisms (hidden goals.)\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately this game just didn&apos;t light my world on fire.  It is OK, but there doesn&apos;t seem to be anything really special or unique about the game that makes me want to play it again.  Perhaps with some more plays I&apos;ll understand more of the strategies, but upon the first play it seemed really difficult to have much control over what buildings get covered.  The voting almost seems like a sideshow that doesn&apos;t really give the players enough power to change what others are doing.

Now it just feels like old hat.\\n\\nThe idea of this game is simple: you have a force of fellows with tanks, crab like things, barges, boat bearing guns, and so forth. They land on a planet covered with valuable ore. You want to collect that ore, which is worth VPs. Said ore can also be turned into additional units, which you will need as there are other folks here with the same goal as you.\\n\\nThe combat system is very simple, if 2 units have another unit in range, they can fire and take it out. There are certainly some timing nuances present, but the idea is easy enough to grok. On the board itself, the terrain can change a bit due to the tides, stranding vehicles at inopportune times. So you get 15 action points and you move around collecting ore and blowing stuff up. \\n\\nWhat this reminds me of is Command &amp; Conquer. The basic premise is very similar, but because this is a table top game, it feels clunky and slow. Sure, you can&apos;t erect buildings with your ore, but you can get extra units, and the combat feels strikingly similar to the real-time strategy genre.\\n\\nI know what you&apos;re thinking...slow? But there&apos;s a timer! Sure there&apos;s a timer, but until you get into some real close competition with the opposition, most of the points are easily burned collecting ore in the back 40 and turns can whisk by in a minute. And while one can feel the time constraints a bit when there are a few timing heavy combat plays to resolve, the timer, for the most part, wasn&apos;t getting as much of a workout as I might have hoped.\\n\\nOverall, I can see why this game is popular with a certain segment of the Geek, but it&apos;s just nothing that speaks to me. I wouldn&apos;t object strenuously to playing it again, but I wouldn&apos;t recommend it.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"cptwacky\" rating=\"7\" value=\"The geek way points me in its direction.

Slurping up resources, buying some new equipment to help slurp up some more.  You can zap people and even capture them if you want.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the timer, the allowcation points, and  it keeps the game from falling into zero-sum banality.  Further, the diceless combat system further tightens up the game so that everything is based off of hard decisions, but the timer voids what would otherwise be nightmarish analysis paralysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis comes close to the most interesting elements of RTS computer games, but confined into a boardgame format.  Zipping around harvest oar from the planet and then trying to take off in time keeps the tension going till the end of the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drawbacks that you have to see past though are that the rules aren&apos;t well written and so you may need to work with them to some degree before playing since the timer is going to get the game rolling and make it awkward to pause everything for clarification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe timer can also be tough for a lot of people.  You have to have real discipline, much less so with the G8 Timer, to make sure that the game keeps flowing constantly and not stopping for whatever reason.

How to be fair?\\nThe gameplay reminded me of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; the computer game as you gather ore and produce tanks for defensive or attacking reasons. As you usually have 15 actionpoints per turn for movement and actions, how the game develops is depending on the players: For half of the game they could collecting ore without fighting if they want so. On the other hand you can attack right away. The experience therefore may be anything between harmless to cutthroat. As I didn&apos;t enjoy the endgame (turn 21 to 25 with restrictions to the liftoff)it prevents me to rate it higher. The bits to color code your miniatures are the tiniest I&apos;ve ever seen, they should have added a pair of tweezers to the game.

But even for those who are knowledgeable about the game, there are still certain characters that are very difficult to effectively play depending on the characters that your opponents choose to play.  Takes ~90 minutes or so to set up the game if you don&apos;t have things organized in the box and can easily take many hours to play with a small group or over a day if you have a large number of players.  \\n\\nHighly recommend trying it out on RealmSpeak (electronic (java based) version of the game) before purchasing the game due to the price that it now sells for on ebay.  And don&apos;t bother trying to contact me about selling my copy, as I&apos;m not parting with it since it is not only an interesting game, but more so because it was a Christmas present back in 1979 that has sentimental value.\\n\\nBut be warned, it can be very intimidating due to the complexity and large number of pieces and time needed to play and to learn.

Despite the appearences this is NOT your standard dungeon crawl/RPG type board game. In all likelyhood this game requires more commitment than most players will ever put into it in order to really see what the game has to offer. Probably not a game that will appeal to a lot of gamers but I sure am glad I own it  and have played it and look forward to playing it in the future.

Nowadays I CBA towards something this complex but you have not lived until you have mastered the Realm!\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"angelusnovus\" rating=\"10\" value=\"The one game to rule them all. \\n\\nAfter 40 years, nothing has come close to reproduce the charm, magic, complexity, depth, and versatility of this game. It does something no other boardgame I know of does: It gives all the players a real sense of danger. This danger comes mainly from monsters, weather effects, locations and discoveries that can harm you or curse you in unpredictable ways at unpredictable times, but it also comes from the possibility of being attacked, robbed, or set back by other players as well. The only games in the market today that might create this sense of danger for the players are either fully cooperative of fully competitive. Magic Realm is the only boardgame that leaves to the players the decision to cooperate to survive together, to hide and avoid the others, or to outright attack or betray each other. Apart from this, the game combines numerous fabulous other systems to create a space for unique experiences and stories that will constantly surprise the players in unimaginable ways. Some of these systems are: \\n\\n- Natives you can hire, or trade with, or attack and loot. Natives you can improve your relationships with by finding treasure they want, or that can learn to hate you through your actions.\\n\\n- Tiles you can enchant to open or close paths and avenues for travel, and to provide a certain type of magic for everyone in the tile. \\n\\n- A combat system that takes dozens of plays to master and it never can be solved completely. The beauty of this combat systems is that it allows for every type of encounter possible. It allows rounds of combat involving close combat, missile attacks, and magic spells with unique effects. It allows for encounters to happen between player(s) and monster(s), player(s) vs player(s), or players working together or separate while dealing with other monsters. Not only that, but it also allows for encounters involving any number of hirelings from a player attacking any number of monsters or players or other players hirelings (or even your own!) present in the clearing where combat is being resolved. small or big monsters can be deadly depending on who are they attacking and when. \\n\\n- Unique game changing treasures and spells that can be found early or late in the game, or never at all, making each session a completely different experience. Treasures is an area that requires many games to master and understand the value of each item. \\n\\n- Monsters and locations that appear randomly in the map depending on the sounds and warnings of each individual tile. While they appear randomly, you can know what to expect and prepare accordingly, although when other characters are near you, danger increases. Uncertainty always occurs and should be taking in consideration in every strategic choice made.\\n\\n- 16+ Assymetrical characters with unique playstyles, abilities, and different relationships with the natives groups. The assymetry of these characters is on par if not superior to the many assymetrical factions and characters seen in recent games today (Mage Knight, Gloomhaven, Vast, Root, etc.). \\n\\n- A programming of actions that allows for strategic planning ahead while at the same time allowing for uncertainty and chaos to happen. Programming your actions requires you to be aware of the possible changes that can occur while your actions take place, and thus your strategic choices are never simple or automated. \\n\\n - The game also brings a sense of discovery through the revealing of information while exploring the map, searching for locations, looting sites for life-changing treasures, and from learning spells from books, scrolls and specific sites. The game even has treasures within treasures with its own unique precious treasures and curses. \\n\\nOn top of all this, the community around Magic Realm is very active thorugh BBG, Discord, and other places, and in the last years, have expanded the game in surpising ways. There is now an unofficial 3rd edition rulebook, a new way to play the game with completely changed victory conditions called The Book of Quests, an Expansion with more of everything, and a Super Realm Project that tries to re-create the vision the genius of Richard Hamblen had for the game that for unfortunate reasons has not come to be in its completed form. \\n\\nThere is also a superb java implementation called Realmspeak that enforces every rule and allows you to play this gem online with other players. There are also at least two modules on TSS with the updated art and automated setup. \\n\\n I have played dozens if not hundreds of modern games, mostly heavy euros, wargames and complex ATs. I don&apos;t think anything in today&apos;s market comes close to Magic Realm in terms of depth, richness, and uniqueness. The only game I can see reaching Magic Realm level is something like ASL. I have played and being mesmerized by both, but ultimately, if I had to pick one, I will choose Magic Realm as the one game to rule them all and in the dakness bind me to it.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"angiolillo\" rating=\"7\" value=\"Nice and interesting...

Subtle-ish references to Tolkien (eg Octopus = Watcher in the Water). Distinctive features that combine to create a unique atmosphere include: personalised victory conditions, turn planning, method of encounter generation, modular two-sided tile board, interesting variety of character options and various flavours of magic.  PVP is great and I would welcome more of it, though you can avoid encountering each other quite easily. Would benefit from massive streamlining, updated art and production, and, primarily, more unified rules.  Combat is highly nuanced (more than necessary).  Very high replay value.  Suggest an initial release with fewer characters and other components.

However, it had always bothered me, even then during the game&apos;s heyday, that it took so long to play. The basic mechanics are fairly straightforward. Battles and seiges are handled very cleverly and still hold up as a model of a good combat system. The various characters, monsters, treasures, races, and kingdoms give this game a rich, heady mix for fantasy lovers. And Dave Trampier&apos;s unparalleled map art really sets the tone for this TSR classic. So why the mediocre rating? Because you really need to be something of an old-school fantasy fan and a bit of a wargaming grognard to fully enjoy and appreciate the game. It takes a long time to play and requires a bit of setting up. Players have many choices to make on their turn which means there is a lot of down time-- which players will use to plot against you. It takes a while to develop an empire and player diplomacy slows the game even more. It can easily repel the ignorant or those used to snappier Euro-style games. In other words, it suffers from all the disadvantages that more contemporary games of the genre and scale have learned to overcome. (There IS a 20-turn limit, however!) Still, this can be a fascinating game with a close group that wants a genuinely rich fantasy game. (Like a Games Workshop game, but without the gratuitous skulls and battle-madness). Your best bet is to find an experienced hand with an original copy of the game and settle in for a lazy Saturday afternoon and evening.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"brownr\" rating=\"7\" value=\"I used played this a lot 25 years ago.

Fun game, if a little random.  No two games play out exactly the same, although there will be similarities.  Promotes the building of &apos;uber-stacks&apos; (of counters). Enough depth and gameplay options to keep you playing for a long, long time.  Best experienced with a group of regular players.  The map board is beautiful.  I have the 25th anniversary edition.  The publisher royally screwed up the rules, to the point that the game is unplayable.  Fortunately, fans have taken the author&apos;s original intention (for this edition) and edited the rules into a working format.  Check the Yahoo Divine Right group.  Plays well even with just two players; if playing with more than 4, use the simultaneous sequence of play variant mentioned in the intermediate rules; the game bogs down otherwise.  Despite all of these flaws, I love the epic feel of this game and the narrative that can develop; feels like reading a fantasy novel sometimes.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Elfbane\" rating=\"7.5\" value=\"Love this game!

One thing I noticed about this game is: It has a severe case of player elimination, the Dwarves in my game attacked the Trolls on Turn one, had a unlikely throw and the king was captured and it was game over for them. Then the Muetar king went to the temple and tried some praying and rolled a 1 and wham-bang he was dead too (he was in the lead at this time) and it came down to a show down between the Trolls and the Rombune and the Trolls won by sacrificing one of their regulars at the altar and destroyed the fleet the Rombune King was traveling on and a bad fate roll for the King and he died too. \\n\\nIt was AWESOME fun solo, the randomized personalities, the alliance system with the NPC kingdoms, the back and forward, the narrative and provoking world the game is situated in, the randomize chit-pull turn order mechanism makes for a great solo experience, there is a zillion ways to mess with the other players and come back from the brink of disaster. At the same time the game rewards good play and controlled risk taking.

I&apos;ll test the expansion later.\\n\\nI think the problem with solo testing is that each player has a lot of information to manage and that might be hard to do with 1 player making it overwhelming. \\n\\nFor example, you need to manage 3 separate types of resources and there is maintenance to pay at the end of the game. So it&apos;s hard to calculate for 3 players. But I think it would be more playable not alone.\\n\\nThe map building is interesting but annoying. It makes a huge amount of time and it is not very strategic. I would say that players should ignore the colors when placing their tiles but keep the other rules. I would even say, draw the top tile and place it somewhere to speed up the game.\\n\\nThe number of tiles does not changes with fewer players and I am wondering if this could unbalance the game since each player could expand on a large territory without fighting each other. Removing tiles breaks the game since some quest cards won&apos;t fit anymore.\\n\\nThe quest mechanic is interesting because it gives you 2 levels of thinking, but they are pretty boring since it&apos;s: go there, now go there, now go there, now get back home. Also having more heroes does not give you more quest to fulfill, so why make more heroes besides decoys.\\n\\nIn the pictures here on BGG some player submitted custom made heroes with various stats. Playing with this would be much more interesting. But unfortunately, he has not put his files on BGG yet. The expansion changes some rules about the heroes and adds new quest, allow the hero to participate in battle, etc. So the expansion is essential.\\n\\nIn my game, the playing field looked empty. I don&apos;t know if it was because we expanded to fast or got bad lucky with the events.\\n\\nThere is also some referencing to do in the book. The expansion have reference sheets that contains many essential tables, but there are still a few tables that can only be found in the rule book. So additional reference stuff would be important.\\n\\nExpansion also add these resources track which are essential and saves you time instead of using tokens to keep track of your resources. Again, expansion is good.\\n\\nThe spells are stupid. Like remaking them from scratch is essential. I only experienced low level spells, so there might be more useful spells. Personally each race should have his own set of spells. One or 2 in each level. Also have some reference sheets for the spells because there are currently on the back of the rulebook.\\n\\nHow by the way, there is no components that allows you to keep track of your heroe&apos;s life. So you have to supply the components, for me I used glass beads on the quest card.\\n\\nSo in overall it&apos;s not a bad game. The expansion correct many bugs and I found it more logical than twilight imperium.\\n\\nBut I suggest removing color matching during placement, adding the heroes cards with different stats and redo the spells to make them different to each race.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nI played another solo game with the expansion and damn, the game is so slow. I don&apos;t know if increasing the maximum units produced every turn could speed up the game.\\n\\nThe combat system is somewhat complex for small battles since it seems to be intended for battles that has a lot of units, which right now never really occurred since everybody spread out to control the largest amount of territories.\\n\\nAnother thing, spells cast by the stars of Timorran are really too weak.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Lobo\" rating=\"5\" value=\"Notv too much innovative.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ludusiovisdiei\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Alan\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"madhatter\" rating=\"5\" value=\"Good system at heart, but the special abilities of each race seem a bit unbalanced.

Variable player abilities and random tile seeding suggest good replay value. Simple combat system - most units have 1 life. Everything inflicts damage on a d10. Enemies are routed on low/medium numbers and killed on high numbers. Archers and Cav have better route/kill numbers than infantry and they strike first. However, an army will break without unrouted (non-archer) infantry. So there is balance between types.

After my first few plays I really thought this game  was going to be an all time favorite, but then I started seeing the dark side of its soul. The general gameplay is superb; one of the most elegant designs I&apos;ve seen. The trouble is in the random events -- they are so powerful that they imbalance the game. Black Death, for example, will end any hope of winning for the player lucky enough to get hit with it. That&apos;s *one card* that puts an end to 7+ hours of gaming no matter how well you&apos;ve played to that point. There are more &quot;pain&quot; cards that have lesser, yet similarly broken, effects. My suspicion is that this game retains its popularity by nostalgia alone. In my opinion there will always be a better way to spend a day than waiting to see who gets the right event cards.

It scales the size of map to the number of players, which was a relatively unique thing for its day and it works well, but the game cries out to be played by a full compliment. However, it is a long game and some of the &quot;event&quot; cards verge on being broken (we either omit a couple of these or do a card draft before play starts).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game was considered to be a streamlined sequel to &quot;Civilization,&quot; and by eliminating the commodity/calamity card collection mechanic, along with the trading and calamity resolution phases, the game was considerably shorter to play than its predecessor. The changes all work together seamlessly and the change to a non-deterministic combat system added a degree of suspense that added interest from the much drier version in Civ. Going to an &quot;event card&quot; system coupled with regional commodity production is an effective way to retain an interesting economic model.\\r\\n\\r\\nI&apos;m always puzzled by the many references I see to the &quot;fiddlyness&quot; of the economics. We&apos;ve never found that, and anyone who wrestled with the commodity combos and card discounts of Civ to figure out what one can afford should find this game considerably simpler.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn even more streamlined version was intended in Manifest Destiny, but after a few playings I&apos;ve concluded that the original AoR is easily the superior game. It is possible to streamline something to death or beyond recognition...\\r\\n\\r\\nThis game is a classic from a great boardgame company (Avalon Hill) at its peak and one still worthy of play by serious gamers; but, owing to its still considerable length, not for everyone.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"bucklen_uk\" rating=\"3\" value=\"Over long, too random for my tastes - with balance problems.

Backstabbing at its best. My personal opinion is that, this game should be played with only one expansion. With the both expansions (Y2K and BFD) together in play the game tends to drag on longer.\\n\\n2016-01-29\\nAfter not playing Illuminati for 6 years, I got rid of it. It was a tough decision, since it was the game that brought me into the hobby.\\n\\nThe main reasons why Illuminati did not hit the table stem form the high levels of abstraction in the game. The rules are quite hard to explain and you&apos;re better be prepared to help the others throughout the whole game (especially in attack and defense). Moreover, you&apos;re constantly craning your neck over the table to read the small print on the cards, which is easy to miss.\\n\\nAnother annoying quality is the unpredictable playing time. A game can drag on for hours, or it can be over in 30 minutes. I also highly recommend not to mix more than one expansion at a time into the deck. With two expansions there is just too much cardboard in the deck, and often for rounds and rounds you&apos;re just drawing the weakest of cards that nobody wants. The highlights of the game are the fierce battles over the strongest cards, after all.\\n\\nHowever, I do miss the moments when everyone was allied with everybody against everyone else. And the look at the face of players when their allies turned against them. With its obvious flaws, Illuminati might not be of a good game design, but it creates memories.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdmiralGT\" rating=\"5\" value=\"More a bit of fun than a strategic game.

The game itself is simple enough after the first play. I love the theme and the concept urged me to read the books. There&apos;s more to this game than the mechanisms. There&apos;s a whole metagame going on that&apos;s argueably more important than the actual game in terms of victory. Without support and allies, winning becomes very difficult.

I still think this is one of the most original, most coolest games I have ever played, no matter that it&apos;s all luck whether the Tower blesses you with a &quot;Lost&quot; when you have the Healer or Dragons your Warriors to cinder.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Chris Busse\" rating=\"5.5\" value=\"Fun family game.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Chris Schreiber\" rating=\"6.5\" value=\"Some very fond family time from my youth was spent around the whirling and dizzying sounds of doors creaking, battle updates, dragons, and haggling in the bazaar. It&apos;s easy to comment on the technological leaps that came with the game (someday this approach to board gaming will rise again) and completely miss that this is also a very beautiful in all artistic respects. Not a great game, but it&apos;s fun to play every once in a while.

I didn&apos;t own it but everytime I went to my friend&apos;s house, I wanted to play, and it never got old. As an adult I purchased one off ebay to fulfill a childhood fantasy of owning it, but after playing half a dozen times it&apos;s lost a lot of its re-play factor. However, when my wife and I babysit our friends&apos; kids, they ALWAYS want to play...just like me. This is the top of the electronic games that came out during the &apos;80s...hell, Orson Welles did the commercials. And the artwork is still stunning. It would be nice if there was a more involved board game version using the same beautiful paintings.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"cinerina\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Used to have this game, played it incessantly - even gave up having a Christmas tree that year so i could have it.

Hex and chit space wargame? That&apos;s exactly up my alley. Insanely complex? Bring it on! Except, unfortunately not. This game is not complex.

I have the 2016 reprint with all the latest rules changes so this is the fairest review that can be given.\\n\\nIn F&amp;E, what you actually do is faithfully remake the entire history of Star Trek, with a few minor accounting differences here and there. The game has an accounting ledger where you write in what you spend and where each turn. However, you can&apos;t build certain ships until certain turns, and you&apos;re just given them. Everything in the game is locked down by areas of space and turn count. It&apos;s like waiting until a certain time to be given permission to actually play this.\\n\\nUnderneath all that is clearly a robust wargame waiting to get out. Unfortunately, we couldn&apos;t even finish this because we were tired of playing &quot;Mother May I&quot; with a board game&apos;s rules. It was insulting from start to finish.

When a word is guessed (only five-letter ones can be built) the guessing player can only win if they have previously reached a score of 25 points: players often build more than one word per game.\\n\\nRunes can be played by three and four players as well. Since opponents can profit from a player&apos;s advances, it&apos;s more recommendable here to use the position guesses if the whole word can&apos;t be guessed at once, or to guess chunks from words by all the other players instead of focussing on one single word.\\n\\nEven though the game might read like a wild word-fest, it surprisingly isn&apos;t: the prevalent feeling is that of a dry, serious but stimulating deduction game. It might even be best played by two, as classic Hangman. \" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"pater pan\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"6/97bs,1/95,fp30/95,\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"PBrennan\" rating=\"4\" value=\"The game comes with 4 types of runes, or sticks, with which you can make up the 26 letters of the alphabet (ie short curves or u&apos;s, half-circles, short sticks, long sticks ... which led inexorably to questions like &apos;do you have a short stick&apos; with suitably phallic replies). Each person secretly chooses a 5 letter word. On a turn, you pick any letter in another persons word and ask if a particular type of rune helps make up that letter. If it does, you get a point and another guess. If it doesn&apos;t, end of go and the other player gets a point instead.\\n\\nAt any time you can guess another player&apos;s word. If you get it right, you score points for the full number of runes that make up the completed word. If wrong, you lose a point for each rune that has so far been guessed correctly on the incomplete word. If you guess correctly, and you&apos;re 25 points or more before the guess, you win the game.\\n\\nFor anyone who has trouble visualising or cycling through word possibilities from incomplete pictures (count me), this is a truly horrible game. If you like this sort of puzzle, it may appeal. In between turns is spent trying to puzzle out other people words (so there&apos;s little perceived downtime) and your go is typically spent working on the word of whoever&apos;s coming last so if you&apos;re not successful, at least its only the last player that gets a point. But the big points are in guessing the words. If you can&apos;t do that, you can&apos;t win.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"PzVIE\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Nice little word game; becomes boring after a few plays. \" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"RichardV\" rating=\"7.5\" value=\"A damned fine word game.  It is fun to choose your secret word, there is tactics in deciding which player to &amp;quot;attack&amp;quot;, and there is deduction and psychology in the play.  The tension is maintained by allowing any player to guess any other players word at any time, so your probes must try and give as little away to the other players as possible.  The scoring system does not penalise false guesses too heavily, so desparation guessing is a viable tactic.

All of this makes playing the game a rather unique experience.\\n\\nDarkover can, by its very nature, only be enjoyed by people that are comfortable with each other (the more players the better); with the wrong group of players petty confrontation or embarrassment can easily arise. Even though its rules are stated to be &quot;easy&quot; there is quite an amount of them to assimilate at first (explaining them to new players while setting up can take more than half an hour). Once these hurdles are overcome, though, the game is one of a kind - exhilarating, chaotic in a good way and original beyond belief.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"paevett\" rating=\"1\" value=\"Worst game ever made.

You have a set of tokens, valued 10 high to 1 low. With these tokens, gain regions, beat up the other players, gain control of some towers maybe, but ultimately control the centre tower with 4 tokens and hold it for a turn to win. Combat is by rock paper scissors. If both players declare rock, enter a psychic duel ... both players chant something inane of choice for 30 seconds, first one to break down laughing or looks away loses. \\r\\n\\r\\nI got beaten up early and found it tough to get back into the game. It ultimately comes down to an Amoeba Wars crap-shoot ... build up and go for the win. If you fail, lick your wounds, try and defend the next player going for the win until you&apos;re ready to launch again. A second playing might get a higher rating, but a 3 after the first game.

The fluidity of provincial ownership is interesting - you have to get over the instinctive fear of losing territory and understand that you can gain by losing ground and reordering your power for a more useful thrust on the next turn.\\n\\nThe dings to my rating come from two issues.  Like Settlers, this game has runaway leadership because of the compounding returns of city growth.  However, it is not as bad as Settlers because you can directly attack the leaders.  I am also not a fan of the deterministic combat both because it removes the drama of battle (see Wallenstein) and makes planning too calculable.

The dice-rolling means that the game is extremely random - maths-based probability-calculating is the only substitute for strategy here. There is tension, as you decide whether to stick or continue rolling. But down-time is a significant issue, especially at four-players. Card-drawing game from the same genre, Diamant (Incan Gold) removes this issue, and makes push-your-luck exciting, as all players advance together. If I wanted to play a dice-roller, I would rather all players were rolling together, as in Dice Town, to reduce down-time.\\n\\nCan&apos;t Stop has all the elements of a classic &quot;traditional&quot; family game.

Works with kids or adults.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adebisi\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Can&apos;t Stop plays fast (usually) and, like the name suggests, definitely offers a lot of chances for pushing your luck. Actually the whole game is about stretching it. Too conservative game will get you nowhere. And, although unlikely, you could basically finish and win the game on your first turn without giving the other player even a chance to roll the dice.\\n\\nThis creates a certain storyline to the game. One lucky player rolls well several times in a row and gets close to finishing the game. S/he has to decide between risking the whole round in an attempt to win immediately or to play it safe and try to win it next round. A safe play results in a situation in which other players realise that they most likely will only have one chance to win. Thus everyone will push it to the very end either succeeding in stealing the win or failing.\\n\\nDespite the somewhat partially scripted gameplay, Can&apos;t Stop offers fun moments. You get to roll a lot of dice and since you cannot control the outcome no two game is the same.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Admiral Fisher\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Can be fun and has a bit of tension at the end of each turn.

It may just be a problem with my play group, who I feel are a bit passive with this game, but even the more interactive sessions feel a bit dry and underwhelming. I definitely love the victory point system and the fact that your points are hidden.\\n\\nUpdate (12/07): After gently pushing my group in a more aggresive direction, the game became much more interesting and fun. 7-&gt;8\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Actorios\" rating=\"10\" value=\"I believe T&amp;E to be the ideal game, sitting somewhere between conquest and german mechanisms.\\n\\nIf you play tactical battle games (such as Risk), you&apos;ll notive that games tend to last for may too long. Units are generally numerous and fights are usually dice fests.\\nAll the more, if you play with 3 or more persons, player eliminations tend to occur before the end of the game.\\nTigris &amp; Euphrates provides you with the benefits of territorial conquest without those drawbacks.\\nIt allows a better pace through a subtile tile placement mechanism which replaces troops moves and offers a score system with which you can &quot;loose a battle without loosing the war&quot;.\\nIf we consider the conflict resolution system, through tiles in hand, it favors deduction and instinctive play, in opposition to cold calculations.\\nThose conflicts, which are almost &quot;games within the game&quot; are considered very carefully by all players because they have the bitter taste of sand for those who lose them and a wonderful flavor for those who win and for who the supremacy is revealed on the board.\\nWith practice, you can better estimate your chances of winnong and better &quot;read&quot; the board and your opponents placements. T&amp;E really develops itself through extensive play. You can improve your tactical skills and practice the art of bluffing, which sometimes allow to deal properly with a poor hand of tiles.\\nAt last, the game materials are splendid with those large wooden leader disks at the &quot;color&quot; of each of the player. Between the two versions of the game (german / american), i&apos;m entirely for the older version which distinguishes by its sobriety and the easy-to-read board and tiles.\\n\\nAmong the blames set on the game, there is its difficulty which makes it a proper game for experienced players only, a lack of them (regularly argued) and the luck factor (the importance of the &quot;red&quot; color).\\nIf it&apos;s true that T&amp;E cannot fit everyone&apos;s needs, the other criticisms are, to my point of view, untrue. Reiner Knizia said, on Geekspeak, that the theme of civilisation raising and falling was at the very origin of the game. It is true that the game is very much streamlined but it was made towards improving the flow of the game and keep a certain simplicity. It does not hurt the joy of playing.\\nAt last, variety rules within the tiles in hand and statistically improbable situations do occur. Those elements provide length of play to the game. As games are played, you have to adapt to your hand as much as to the board and seek the advantages of both. All the more, monuments and treasure provide solutions to deal with the luck of the draw.\\n\\nIf I only had to make one statement against the game, it would be related to the turn order. As proved on the BGG interface, first persons to play have a double advantage of choosing their starting location and of being potentially able to play more than other players.\\nThis small drawback is the price to be paid for a very good game and it is up to the players at the table to remember it and compensate favor of destiny.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ACTP\" rating=\"8\" value=\"Played by lo\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adalbert\" rating=\"7.5\" value=\"what I don&apos;t like about the game is that although it has a theme it feels totally abstract. otherwise a very good and unique euro.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adam.skinner\" rating=\"7.5\" value=\"Wow, what a great game.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adam78\" rating=\"10\" value=\"I have played this a lot on the iPad, and I&apos;m glad I held off on purchasing a physical copy until I was well-immersed in the hobby.

I like how the conflict is different than a war game, it&apos;s based on tiles, but then after a conflict the tiles clear out offering opportunities for other players. The lesser-of-four point system is a great mechanism, it forces players to push for different colored points at different times in the game.\\n\\nDISLIKE: Big plans can go awry with one simple catastrophe tile, quickly changing the state of the board, which means the game can feel tactical over strategical. The tiles drawn can be random, also stalling strategies. The game can get a little long from analyzing the board state each turn. \\n\\nOVERALL: Very good game, a true classic. It is an aggressive game, and can be debilitating, but players know this going in. Also helpful to know is how different combos in the spacial puzzle can be good or bad, because new players should not unknowingly be leaving opportunities for experienced players early in the game.\\n\\nIt feels like Samurai, but I like this a bit more.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"9\" value=\"Probably Knizia&apos;s masterpiece.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamw\" rating=\"8\" value=\"This is one of those games that has rightfully earned its place in the top 10 games of all time.

The lowest score of your set of scores wins, so you have to carefully balance all opportunities.

I like the part about laying down one stock only and being able to commit sabotage against an opponent, both denying them potential income and blocking a route option.  I dislike that one plays through the whole stock deck before the game ends as the endgame dwindles into a collect all the stock you can and then lay them down as you win majorities - very little angst or fear about the game ending prematurely with a fourth scoring card that denotes the end of the game and final scoring for Union Pacific.

I have not yet played Union Pacific, so I can not compare the two. Airlines is a clever stock investment game about establishing airline companies and expanding the routes, thereby receiving and accumulating stock shares. The top two stock holders in each airline score points towards victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn interesting feature of the game is that the scoring rounds are randomly determined via the dreaded &quot;Wertung&quot; (scoring) cards. Some players dislike this mechanism because it introduces some randomness, but I think this doesn&apos;t detract from the game and more than justify itself due to the level of anxiety it adds to each and every turn. If the randomness really bothers you, there is always the commonly used randomness mitigating method of spliting the stocks deck into 3 roughly equal parts and shuffling in one Wertung card in each and then stacking  the 3 parts into one draw pile. Alhambra uses a similar method to kick off scoring rounds.  You can even go further and set aside about 10 cards before splitting the deck into 3 parts and shuffling in the Wertung cards. Then stack the 3 parts and put the 10 cards on top. This prevents a premature scoring round.\\r\\n  \\r\\n-\\r\\n\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"rajungamer\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Predecessor to Union Pacific and Airlines Europe.\\nI much prefer both of those.

You have to follow suit (5 colors), but if you can&apos;t, your card&apos;s value still applies.  Cards range in value from 1 to 18.

The lack of strategy and depth keeps this from being a 9 or 10, but it is excellent for what it is -- a pseudo-gambling dice game.\\n\\nRaised to an 8 (9/27/13).

The set you auction is up to that player&apos;s discretion, and this is where alot of the strategy is, in the set offerings.  The highest bid takes the set, and all players continue until everyone has five total tiles.  The highest tile total(s) score points.  Then the goods are loaded onto the ships- the highest(s) in each ship also score points, then you can also score extra points for moving exceptionally high within a boat.  3 rounds and the game is over.\\r\\n\\r\\nI&apos;ve heard that this game is only good for 6 (which makes it valuable for that sake alone, not many good 6-player games), but definitely enjoyed my 4-player games of this, so I think it probably scales well, plus it&apos;s relatively short and easy to learn/play.\\r\\n\\r\\nCopy signed by R.

Dry theme-- I think it could have been a pet store theme to attract a more diverse audience.

The rules are so simple, the entire game truly hinges on your ability to maneuver your opponents into poor bids or slink in to gain a set of cards for a low price - or even free if played right. I love that it extends from 2 to 6 players as well. However, it is a fairly sterile experience unless you really enjoy a pure bidding conflict.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Admiral Fisher\" rating=\"9\" value=\"A gem of a game.  The version of the game by Rio Grande that I own has decent artwork and the box looks quite opulent.  I know some of the previous incarnations have been dreadful, but this one is fine.  The board could do with being 10% bigger though as the pieces don&apos;t go on very well - or as a friend of mine said - pegs and a hole board would be a good way of scoring the markets.\\n\\nThe game itself could be viewed (if you were so inclined) as rather mathematical, yet I didn&apos;t find myself attempting to calculate every single nuance as I might have done in Modern Art.  I think that the maths is obscured by the fact that you&apos;re hardly ever sure what is left in the bag or how your position within the various scoring components is going to come out each round. Thus the overall feeling is of a rough calculation rather than a precise one...and this is greatly to the game&apos;s benefit.  So, it&apos;s a much simpler game than Modern Art, yet loses nothing for it.  It&apos;s also really elegant, plays in 40-50 mins and is a lot of fun. I didn&apos;t find it dry at all.  I think it will get a lot of play when there is 50-60 mins left in a session.\\n\\nI love auction games and Knizia is the master.  All of the famous ones are extremely strong.  For me, this one is the best as it&apos;s the most elegant and works with numbers from 3-6 (I haven&apos;t tried playing with 2).  We always have loads of repartee and joking playing the game.

Pure negotiation chaos, which makes the game very unique, but necessarily great.   Can be frustrating if your store tiles and/or locations are in bad spots- true you can often turn them into valuable items for others, but sometimes there&apos;s just nothing that can be done.  There are also random event cards drawn at the end of each round, which can have a not unsignificant impact on income.

In practice though, a lot of the skill of the game seems to be in small efficiencies, rather than in securing big exciting trades. This is fine, and arguably makes it more tactically interesting, but just makes it less exciting to me. It also makes it very difficult to have any sense of who is winning. \\n\\nIt also FEELS very random.

However, the game plays relatively quick which is a good thing.\\n\\n\\n2013/01\\nMy comments above are in line with a rating of 6.\\n7-&gt;6\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adilibe\" rating=\"9\" value=\"Brilliant game!\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdmiralACF\" rating=\"6\" value=\"*Rating based on one play.\\n\\nThis older title is almost pure negotiation.  There&apos;s just enough to the game to make things to negotiate over, but the meat of the game is in the negotiation.  For that reason, it&apos;s a highly interactive game, but not in a take-that kind of way.  Rather, it&apos;s almost semi-cooperative in that you have to think about what the other players want in order to make appealing offers to them, or at least be able to convince them that a deal is good for them.  I enjoyed this type of interaction.\\n\\nHowever, I feel the game is just a bit too simple for my taste.  I would have liked a few more layers of depth to it.  I also felt that the end game was rather disappointing.  Maybe it was just the way our first play shook out, but there were almost no trades in the final round, which felt anti-climactic.  I feel like there needs to be more of a ramp in income for larger, incomplete businesses.  As it was, in the final round, my options were limited to playing out my three tiles for $1,000 each, or buying a matching one for an extra $2,000, but at the cost of $1,000 for the tile and the loss of $1,000 for having an extra tile I couldn&apos;t play.  The other players were largely in the same position, so the last round was very unexciting.\\n\\nIn the end, I felt it was a decent game, but felt it had some room for improvement.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdmiralGT\" rating=\"5\" value=\"Based on a single 3 player game.

I like Chinatown, though don&apos;t know that I&apos;d ever ask to play it.

How many dare I bid on this year&apos;s agenda in order to gain a privilege (for more resources) or build a bit of the cathedral (worth victory points), given that I&apos;ll later need cards to build huts (more resources or more v.p.s when building the cathedral), attack other players or defend myself. \\n\\nEven back in the twentieth century, a few rough edges to this design were apparent.  Playing with the rules as written, it was quite easy for someone to get shut out and have no fun at all.  I play with a couple of house rules suggested by Derek Carver; an &quot;uncle at court&quot; who allows a single change of agenda card, and a player whose privilege is stolen is allowed to pick another from the stock.  All the same, grabbing a privilege early feels essential; six points for building a single piece of cathedral is huge.\\n\\nThe game is nicely produced with big chunky blocks of wood and decent quality cards.

The type of auction influences how many points of bidding power each type of resource in the game is worth (players have a hand of resources).  The winner of the auction is going to score some points, and maybe also gain a king&apos;s favor, which allows him to draw an extra resource each turn.\\n\\nWhen the auction is over.  Players can then play resources to build up their fiefs, or play resources to screw with people, destroying their fiefs.  Once players are done screwing around with this, they get to draw cards based on their fiefs and favors, and a new round is started.\\n\\nSo, the game boils down to some pretty boring auctions with take-that card play in between them.  There&apos;s a somewhat interesting decision in how much to bid vs. how much to hold back for the screwery phase since both phases utilize the cards in your hand, but overall it&apos;s just a boring exercise.\\n\\nIt&apos;s really too bad the game play doesn&apos;t live up to the awesome overproduced bits!

I read through the rules, but could not find time to try the game. I gave it a few half-hearted tries, to no avail, and eventually sold it off. My girlfriend wanted to keep the game since it featured a circular board, and that, in her opinion, meant that it couldn&apos;t be bad.\\n\\nNow forward to a few years later when I was able to attempt the game anew, seriously this time. It was a disaster. The rules did not go over well, although my fellow players eventually caught on. But they despised the silly card mechanics which seemed to provoke hitting on each other for no good reason other than to curtail their ability to score points. The game&apos;s annoying tendency to &apos;reset&apos; itself—meaning that whatever you do is always fleeting and any plan you care to think of easily ruined by other players—soon had everyone&apos;s teeth on edge. Take for example the &apos;bonus&apos; points you&apos;re able to obtain by having huts near the cathedral. It takes quite a lot of effort on your behalf to put them there. But you can be targetted by all other players to lose them. The only defense is having a lot of cards. But then you don&apos;t get to bid for the destiny card which is the only way in which you&apos;re able to build a cathedral section [i]and[/i] you run the risk of losing cards thanks to the blunt equaliser called the Emperor&apos;s Mercy. Everything you can think of has been offset by something at least equally nasty. In this way, Charlemagne resembles the horrible Beestenveiling (High Society). The winner of the game is the player who did not lose as much as the others.\\n\\nWe broke off after a few rounds, so I cannot say whether the infamous 1-1-1-2-2-3 point awarding table is good or bad. I suspect bad, as huts near cathedrals are prime candidates for torching. And then... My girlfriend made a face and pronounced this title [i]really[/i] bad and stupid. And very grudgingly admitted I was right at the time in selling it off. In other words: avoid this turd unless you like excessively confrontational games where weasling is the only option and having a lucky break is the only thing which may win the game for you. A rating of &apos;2&apos; may sound harsh as the game isn&apos;t really broken, and I sure can stomach direct conflict; but the approach where as a player you are expected to build something you cannot properly defend seems so annoyingly pointless that I won&apos;t play this game ever again.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"czrdup\" rating=\"5\" value=\"Alright, but doesn&apos;t really grab me.

Krieg und Frieden is a game that I have admired from a far for a long time now.  I always liked how it looked with it&apos;s round board, and chunky wooden bits, but for some reason I never really pursued it.  Well things change and I was finally able to obtain a copy and get it to the table rather quickly.  My fanciful wonderings were not misled.  I played with the Stuart Dagger variant, as suggested, and was soon taken by the elegant little design here.  I will agree with the geeks that say this is primarily a card game, but the bits in this one add a lot.  The mechanics are clever in that all the cards in hand, are currency for all actions in the game (similar in a sense to San Juan).  This makes solid  hand management crucial.  Although Krieg is entirely based around the cards and card draw, the ability to change the year&apos;s agenda makes having a bad draw almost moot - this occurs because one can, by sacrificing a priveledge, change the value of all the cards and turn their hand from weak to strong.   With the cards being the currency for all things, one has to decide when to sacrifice cards for actions.  There are more strategies in Krieg than are apparent in the first few rounds -  Taking control of the agenda, when to downsize to obtain the king&apos;s bounty( a move that is double edged), and when and how many cards to risk to burn an opponents village are just a few.  Krieg und Frieden is more than a pretty package, it offers a lot of game play and is sadly over looked here on the geek.  I can&apos;t wait to play again.\\n\\nUPDATE:  I find the complaints that the last turn is overpowered unwarranted.  If you can control the agenda, as not to finish too early, then you can either secure your lead by winning priviledges and a victory point or play a little catch up and allowing yourself to strengthen your hand.  Also the suggestion this game is lost in the first couple rounds is false in my opinion.  If you control the agendas early on and run out too quickly , then your game is at the mercy of those who still have them.  Timing is essential here, and again so is smart hand management.\\n\\nnot really an update:  Proposed variant not yet played: if in winning the agenda bid, the player has the option to either take the alloted one victory point and priviledge or be allowed to take two VP&apos;s and no priviledge. Does anyone think this may have a strong effect on the end game, as far as the strength of the final cathedral build?\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"frwings\" rating=\"8\" value=\"Very good bluff game\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Galapagos\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Dutch version - Charlemagne (999 games)\\r\\nSlightly broken.

I guess its because I feel so constrained when I play the game.  You make decisions at the beginning at the game and at some point it just feels like you&apos;re just playing it out.  Its now a 4 and may well go lower soon.\\nUpdate2: Talked about it with my girlfriend, she pointed out mistakes I made during the play tried it again tonight, its back to a 6.  You do have a bit more control than I realized.  I thought it was missing a tactical element, but it was just that i wasn&apos;t paying attention.

My S.O. and I normally play medium-length at 3-5 rounds. \\n\\nScoring system is very well designed and forces players to evaluate risk / reward of every expedition and card play.  The game can frustrate a lot of people since you are frequently forced to make undesirable decisions, but it&apos;s really a matter of minimizing the harm, and maximizing potential reward. \\n\\nOnly downside to the game is that there is a significant luck element in which cards you draw.  However, I find that this normally evens out when playing a 5+ round game. \\n\\nI&apos;m giving it a &quot;8&quot; for strategy, fun, and short / flexible length of the game.

You can learn to play this in minutes but it will take a few plays to figure out the nuances.  Fast and fun so you can play many times in a session.  No direct interaction with your opponent - you play your cards on your cards and discard to common discard piles and draw from a single draw pile until it is exhausted.  Game ends when draw pile is depleted and with both players holding a full hand of cards.  The interaction with your opponent is more about misdirection of your intentions and what cards to show him or continue to hold in your hand.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aarong3eason\" rating=\"9\" value=\"iOS only\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaronmajor\" rating=\"N/A\" value=\"Opened, unplayed, cards still in shrink.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaronseeber\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Agonising decisions aplenty, but pretty simple.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaronsibley\" rating=\"6\" value=\"Good quick game to play on an evening.\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aarontu\" rating=\"3\" value=\"A simple 2-player card game with colorful pictures on the cards.

You take some risks and sometimes it pays off big time, otherwise it doesn&apos;t.  After I read all the indepth reviews I was beginning to wonder why I ordered it.  Normally I don&apos;t want a card game involving numbers.  I tend to think of it as just more darned Rummy or Rook.  Well, I was wrong.  This is a great game and another reason I&apos;m learning to love Knizia.  This game is just such a great pick-up game for 2 people, beautifully done.  The board and cards just add to the flavor of the game.  I originally expected something a lot different based on the description so I was disappointed... until I actually played it!

If you are the owner, you love it because it is easy to teach and to carry with you. If you are just a player, you love it because it is easy to learn, plays quick and offers meaningful decisions to make. There are few other games that are so simple but still offer a healthy amount of things to ponder.\\n\\nTo answer my initial question, I have to say that I am inclined to put Lost Cities into the category of good averages. This is because in the long run the game becomes a bit repetitive. By this I am referring to the fact that most of the time you are just making wild guesses when starting an expedition. Of course, you can try to read your opponent&apos;s hand and thus make good or better guesses, but still most of the excitement in drawing the cards.\\n\\nNevertheless, Lost Cities is a good 2-player game for occasional playing.\\n\\n2008-07-10\\nEasy to learn but because of the luck factor can never be truly mastered. Good planning is still needed though. A light game to play even with my parents.\" />\\n\\t\\t</comments>\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n   \\t\\t<statistics page=\"1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<ratings >\\n\\t\\t\\t<usersrated value=\"37314\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<average value=\"7.17729\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<bayesaverage value=\"7.08032\" />\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<ranks>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<rank type=\"subtype\" id=\"1\" name=\"boardgame\" friendlyname=\"Board Game Rank\" value=\"325\" bayesaverage=\"7.08032\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<rank type=\"family\" id=\"5499\" name=\"familygames\" friendlyname=\"Family Game Rank\" value=\"65\" bayesaverage=\"7.09656\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</ranks>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<stddev value=\"1.26991\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<median value=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<owned value=\"51803\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<trading value=\"889\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<wanting value=\"479\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<wishing value=\"4058\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<numcomments value=\"8912\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<numweights value=\"2915\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<averageweight value=\"1.4957\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t</ratings>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</statistics>\\n     \\n\\t\\n          \\n</item>\\n</items>'"

      "     In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;\n",

The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.\">\n",

In my sessions, I found that it typically comes to a point where a \"leader\" is set and it can sway to some players just moving through the motions to accomplish the overall goal.

      "Fantastic!  Easy to learn, compelling, fun, co-operative without 1 player dominating, great balance, excellent ability to make the game more difficult, edge of the seat tension, \"we'd have won if only.....\", quick to play, \"lets play again\"-ness, cheap, cheering on the viruses!  What more could you want in a boardgame?\n",
      "I'm not a big fan of co-operative games. This is one of the best (and has a very clever card recycling mechanism which keeps the pressure on the players) but it's still a co-operative game\n",
      "Such a solid game. I'm in the middle of playing Legacy, however, and I'm afraid that I won't want to play \"vanilla\" Pandemic after that. We shall see. \n",
      "\n",
      "As far as Co-Ops go, the only real problem with base Pandemic is the tendency to have \"optimal plays\", which almost negates any player feeling like they are truly in control of their turns. However, this was the game that taught me how to NOT be the \"alpha gamer\", and let the game play out as it would in real life. That made the game much more enjoyable - even if it led to more defeats. \n",
      "Thank you Secret Santa 2008!\n",
      "I really dig into the theme, but the QB issue has finally sucked some of my enjoyment out of the game. The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.\n",

Milk that cow dry, Matt. Anyway i found Pandemic inferior to F. Island. It is fiddlier just for the sake of it and drags on a bit longer.\n",

It's still a classic, but it is old enough, that there are now better gateway games coming out ever year.  Even so, if you enjoy the theme, then this is still a solid game.\n",

      "The go-to co-op game.  Scales ingeniously.\n",
      "In my ongoing search for cooperative games that are worth playing (I tend to dislike them), I bought this classic. Game came in a nice box with nice components and the artwork looks good. Tried it solo a few times to learn the rules, and the experience was surprisingly good. I don't particularly enjoy solo gaming, but I think I prefer it to cooperative gaming. This one's no exception.\n",
      "Very cool mechanics!  The processes of an \"outbreak\" feels as it should: stressful and in need of co-op strategy all the while keeping the fun in it.  Solid with 4 players.  Played a few sessions in solo mode and it seems to work as well.  Co-Op is heavy leaning.  In my sessions, I found that it typically comes to a point where a \"leader\" is set and it can sway to some players just moving through the motions to accomplish the overall goal.  Of course, this is all based off the group and how each individual prefers play.  Highly suggest individuals that simply enjoy puzzle mechanics (problem solving systems) and like working together through the process.\n",
      "a cooperative game that is huge fun and very difficult. great play mechanics and player roles means no two games are going to be the same.\n",
      "I need to play this more to properly evaluate it, but so far it looks like the best co-op game ever made, and second place isn't even close.  Great theme, good components, tough game system, smooth gameplay, and looks like some interesting expansions in the pipeline.  I should add that I'm not really into co-op games, so maybe giving it only a 7.5 doesn't do it justice.\n",

It seems as long as one person has a strong understanding of the game they can simply instruct the other players and come out winning, which doesn't say much for the \"cooperative\" aspect of the game...

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.&#10;&#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&#10;&#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&#10;&#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;\""

The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.\n",

Tried it solo a few times to learn the rules, and the experience was surprisingly good. I don't particularly enjoy solo gaming, but I think I prefer it to cooperative gaming. This one's no exception.\n",
      "8 Very cool mechanics!  The processes of an \"outbreak\" feels as it should: stressful and in need of co-op strategy all the while keeping the fun in it.  Solid with 4 players.  Played a few sessions in solo mode and it seems to work as well.  Co-Op is heavy leaning.  In my sessions, I found that it typically comes to a point where a \"leader\" is set and it can sway to some players just moving through the motions to accomplish the overall goal.  Of course, this is all based off the group and how each individual prefers play.  Highly suggest individuals that simply enjoy puzzle mechanics (problem solving systems) and like working together through the process.\n",
      "8.9 a cooperative game that is huge fun and very difficult. great play mechanics and player roles means no two games are going to be the same.\n",

Great theme, good components, tough game system, smooth gameplay, and looks like some interesting expansions in the pipeline.  I should add that I'm not really into co-op games, so maybe giving it only a 7.5 doesn't do it justice.\n",

I know I can be this kind of player myself, and I hate that the game doesn't do anything to smack me down and keep the collaboration even among players. While it is intensely satisfying to dream up a last-ditch effort to save the world and win the game, it's frustrating that the game doesn't force you to come up with that plan together. \n",

However, once it was done I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied... \"that's it?\". It is difficult however when teaching new people to not basically play the game for them (do this, do that). It seems as long as one person has a strong understanding of the game they can simply instruct the other players and come out winning, which doesn't say much for the \"cooperative\" aspect of the game... I would play it again, but I traded it away as it didn't see much play from my shelf.\n",

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.\"></comment>\n",

The processes of an \"outbreak\" feels as it should: stressful and in need of co-op strategy all the while keeping the fun in it.  Solid with 4 players.  Played a few sessions in solo mode and it seems to work as well.  Co-Op is heavy leaning.  In my sessions, I found that it typically comes to a point where a \"leader\" is set and it can sway to some players just moving through the motions to accomplish the overall goal.  Of course, this is all based off the group and how each individual prefers play.  Highly suggest individuals that simply enjoy puzzle mechanics (problem solving systems) and like working together through the process.'></comment>\n",

       "<comment rating=\"10\" username=\"AaronD\" value=\"A really addictive game with lots of replay value.  It's fast paced, and easy to learn.  It's also one of those rare games that's even fun when you lose. This is a must-play game in my books.\"></comment>\n",

Anyone can pick it up and figure it out while still keeping more veteran players engaged. Definiently a must have for any collection. If only, though, there was some way to make it even better....cough*legacy*cough...\"></comment>\n",

       "<comment rating=\"7.5\" username=\"Aarontu\" value=\"A co-op game that is fun and relatively easy to learn and plays in a short amount of time. Each game tends to be very different and they are usually tense to the end. It's fun to give each disease a name and then watch it spread or try to cure it. The city spots are way too small for all the stuff that can go on them, though; a single pawn is larger than a city space!\"></comment>\n",

However, once it was done I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied... &quot;that's it?&quot;. It is difficult however when teaching new people to not basically play the game for them (do this, do that). It seems as long as one person has a strong understanding of the game they can simply instruct the other players and come out winning, which doesn't say much for the &quot;cooperative&quot; aspect of the game... I would play it again, but I traded it away as it didn't see much play from my shelf.\"></comment>\n",

But since it is a friendly and relaxing coop experience I'm glad I have it in my collection. Rules are easy to teach. What worries me so far is the apparent lack of depth. I didn't get a sense of having interesting choices when playing. What to do and when seemed rather obvious. But that might very well change after some more plays.\n",
