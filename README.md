# Project 5: Do You Want to Play Something Else
## Board Game Recommender
#
## Description
At the beginning of the pandemic with stay-at-home orders, many had to find sources of entertainment. One of the largest and most common forms are board games. But outside of the well-known, mass-produced, "toy store" board games found at major retailers, many do not know about hobby board games nor how to find ones they would enjoy. This project seeks to develop a content-based recommendation system to provide usable results for a user based on known board games they do enjoy. It allows the ability to further filter results by attributes such as number of players and minimum age, as well as removing variations of a game from results.
