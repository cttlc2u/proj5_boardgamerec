Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn\\'t be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother\\'s side, would be delighted.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&amp;mdash;leading to immense variety.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Dominion series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<yearpublished value=\"2008\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<minplayers

       "<description>&amp;quot;You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&amp;mdash;leading to immense variety.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Dominion series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

       "<description>In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

I'm in the middle of playing Legacy, however, and I'm afraid that I won't want to play &quot;vanilla&quot; Pandemic after that. We shall see.   As far as Co-Ops go, the only real problem with base Pandemic is the tendency to have &quot;optimal plays&quot;, which almost negates any player feeling like they are truly in control of their turns. However, this was the game that taught me how to NOT be the &quot;alpha gamer&quot;, and let the game play out as it would in real life.

The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.\"/>\n",

The processes of an \"outbreak\" feels as it should: stressful and in need of co-op strategy all the while keeping the fun in it.  Solid with 4 players.  Played a few sessions in solo mode and it seems to work as well.  Co-Op is heavy leaning.  In my sessions, I found that it typically comes to a point where a \"leader\" is set and it can sway to some players just moving through the motions to accomplish the overall goal.  Of course, this is all based off the group and how each individual prefers play.  Highly suggest individuals that simply enjoy puzzle mechanics (problem solving systems) and like working together through the process.'/>\n",

I won't play 2-player with her, though.   I am finding Pandemic Legacy to be a whole lot more interesting, because your decisions carry over from game to game, and it communicates the tension of the theme more effectively. Base Pandemic is just absolutely boring. I think that the base game needs a random deck of 'objective' cards (similar to how you face different objectives in Pandemic Legacy) to spruce it up and keep it fresh.   Beyond that, something that I dislike in all of Matt Leacock's games is the alpha player tendency. I know I can be this kind of player myself, and I hate that the game doesn't do anything to smack me down and keep the collaboration even among players. While it is intensely satisfying to dream up a last-ditch effort to save the world and win the game, it's frustrating that the game doesn't force you to come up with that plan together.   It's Pandemic. I have problems with the alpha-player tendency (which the game does nothing to curb) and the repetitiveness, but it's everyone's favorite co-op for a reason.\"/>\n",

The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.\"/>,\n",

I won't play 2-player with her, though.   I am finding Pandemic Legacy to be a whole lot more interesting, because your decisions carry over from game to game, and it communicates the tension of the theme more effectively. Base Pandemic is just absolutely boring. I think that the base game needs a random deck of 'objective' cards (similar to how you face different objectives in Pandemic Legacy) to spruce it up and keep it fresh.   Beyond that, something that I dislike in all of Matt Leacock's games is the alpha player tendency. I know I can be this kind of player myself, and I hate that the game doesn't do anything to smack me down and keep the collaboration even among players. While it is intensely satisfying to dream up a last-ditch effort to save the world and win the game, it's frustrating that the game doesn't force you to come up with that plan together.   It's Pandemic. I have problems with the alpha-player tendency (which the game does nothing to curb) and the repetitiveness, but it's everyone's favorite co-op for a reason.\"/>,\n",

However, once it was done I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied... &quot;that's it?&quot;. It is difficult however when teaching new people to not basically play the game for them (do this, do that). It seems as long as one person has a strong understanding of the game they can simply instruct the other players and come out winning, which doesn't say much for the &quot;cooperative&quot; aspect of the game... I would play it again, but I traded it away as it didn't see much play from my shelf.\"/>,\n",
       " <comment rating=\"3\" username=\"Abhoth_\" value=\"Played twice. So far I don't quite see why some of my friends hold this game in such high regard. But since it is a friendly and relaxing coop experience I'm glad I have it in my collection. Rules are easy to teach. What worries me so far is the apparent lack of depth. I didn't get a sense of having interesting choices when playing. What to do and when seemed rather obvious. But that might very well change after some more plays.  Edit: Some more plays has confirmed my earlier worries. Both my wife and I consider the game rather pointless. There is little strategy, and thus victory or failure is mostly a matter of luck, not tactics or skill.\"/>,\n",
